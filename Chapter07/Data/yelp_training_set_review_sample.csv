Picture somebody you really like and want to be your friend saying these things in a really annoying dramatic tone; ""Oh my god, I have to have it right now!"".  ""This is the best thing on the planet!!""  ""Dude, you're insane if you don't love this.""  I bet you can guess what I'm referring to by now, it is indeed the infamous Grilled Cheese and Tomato soup ""snack"" bonered over by pretty much everybody I've ever met in CenPho.  Now I'll be honest, I've only been to the Roosevelt twice, and actually had a good time both times, but I had to give it 3 stars for a couple little nit-picky things, as well as the fact that I'm anti-bandwagon when it comes to sports, and food.  

Really?!  I had better tomato soup on Continental Airlines for christ's sake.  I am not a big soup eater, but I've always appreciated tomato soup for its dip-ability, and simplicity.  I dont need a full salad of basil in the soup, and honestly I found it kinda watery.  Again, maybe its just because of the people who its got bent over telling me how bomb it is, but all I could think was ""meh"".  

I can also cook a better grilled cheese with the bread from Tent City (don't worry about why I know what the Tent City bread is like) on a linoleum countertop with a clothes iron, while getting robbed, attacked by a wild boar (which I would subdue with the iron), and nagged by the super annoying chick that I mistakenly dated for a couple weeks last year.  I'm not a foodie, so I don't remember specifically what kind of bread and cheeses were used, but I do remember waaaay to much of said bread, and not nearly enough cheese, for 8 bucks.  8 bucks?!  Send me to Safeway, fuck that, Food City with 8 bucks and I'll make you a grilled cheese and tomato soup that will leave you begging for a cigarette.  

But I digress.  Actually, overall, I like the Roosevelt.  The high top tables were rickety as shit and the little candle on the table served more as a way for me to burn myself testing my manhood by holding my hand over it than a light source.  The place itself is cute, and I've always liked places that have a homey feel.  Our waitress was wonderful, and even gave us some in depth info on where they get some of their ingredients.  I have one more gripe, and it's that I was apparently an asshole for asking for a bourbon, and not knowing before I stepped inside that they only serve beer and wine.  The bartender looked at me like I was a moron (which she has every right to do b/c she's dead on) and told me to rethink my selection of Wild Turkey on the rocks.  I love Oak Creek, so I was pleased to see that they carried it, but I think they probably lose the business of some people looking for a cocktail.

So, I'm more than confident that you will enjoy the Roosevelt, but if somebody tells you that you'll never have a better grilled cheese in your life, go in with the mentality that they're just making sure that the chick/dude they're lusting after thinks they have good taste.  You'll never get her anyway broseph.",review,6,vXnfpkOK2djHNVsUxpSioQ

An old friend was in town and we knew they had a heated cigar-friendly patio...... note I said ""HAD.""

Yeah... apparently, this location (and this location ONLY) has decided to allow cigarettes on their patio...... but not cigars or pipes anymore (OFF the Yelp Cigar Patio list for you!).

INSERT SLIGHTLY OFF-TOPIC VENT HERE:

What's with the new trend that allows cigarettes but not pipes and/or cigars, by the way?!

Lemme see... cigarettes smell like burning paper full of chemically treated dried leaves.... because that's what they ARE!  They stink... people often smoke several in succession...... and I'm sorry cigarette smokers, but a certain shall-we-say uncouth crowd can sometimes accompany them, right?  C'mon... even you cigarette smokers have to admit that you've run into more toothless idiots than intellectuals in smoking areas.

Cigars, on the other hand, are completely pure tobacco leaves, not dried, no chemicals added, no burning paper...... so the aromas are much more pleasant (albeit still smoke) and don't stick to clothes, walls, etc... like cigarettes.  Adding to that is that cigars are generally smoked by middle aged men with some affluence since they cost anywhere from 10 to 150 bucks a pop for anything decent.  Pipes are an even more pleasant aroma (since they're often treated and blended specifically for that purpose) and attract an even older and just-as-refined crowd, as a rule.

So... I don't get it...... is it maybe the volume of smoke that some cigars can produce?  Then it SEEMS like the guy with a cigar is creating the smoke smell coming from th patio?  Is it just that we're all USED to the cigarette smell on patios but our noses are alerted when cigars are around because it's so much more infrequent?  I dunno.......... but it's a pretty dumb trend that I've run into twice now (the Yard House at West Gate has the same stupid rule)... so SOMEONE has to have a reason (the server certainly didn't have one apart from, ""I dunno.  It's just our manager's policy now... I don't get it either and I just came from another Rock Bottom where we all LOVE our regulars that cigars and pipes bring in.""

Sigh...

END SLIGHTLY OFF-TOPIC VENT.

On top of that, their beers have never been anything more than just decent micro-brews (although I hear some other brewmasters do a better job in the Valley)... the food is just OKAY...  We DID happen to get great service last night, but that isn't the norm, especially when you're sitting in the please-completely-neglect-and-or-forget-about-me section known as the ""patio.""

In fact... the only thing that's ever brought us back here was their cigar-friendly patio....... oops..... looks like we've made our last visit...",review,3,yy3jXczrKljJGzjo24HWfw

The small, charming spot is tucked away from the nightclub scene and hidden in the art gallery district. It has a cute little patio and a bar you can sit at, in addition to a few tables within the restaurant.

You can get some delicious appetizers and desserts to accompany the dozens of wines they serve. I recommend the cheese platter ($12.95), which consists of a generous portion of a variety of cheese, plus grapes, olives and crackers.

And the Caprese salad ($9.99) was a stellar portion of thickly-cut slices of mozzarella and beef steak tomatoes. This was one of the best-valued caprese salads I've ever had, and it tasted delicous.

Su Vino's obvious big draw is its wine. You can try a wine flight of five different types for only $10, and you can also purchase glasses and bottles.

Another cool thing you can do at Su Vino is bottle your own wine, complete with custom labels -- perfect for parties or special occasions.

And then there are those board games you can play while sipping on your wine. It's a great way to relax and have a low-key evening in Old Town Scottsdale!",review,2,v2UqlUHA8d3lgTIby0CCFQ

Unfortunately, my recent Friday night visit (6:45 - 9pm) did not leave me so giddy...
There was no room in the main dining room and since this was Date Night with the hubby (as opposed to Fire Sale at The Local Meat Market) we opted for the ""quiet side of the patio"" out front.

As far as the food goes, it started off GREAT. The scallops appetizer was nothing short of perfect (my husband concurs)--sauteed in a pesto and SO juicy. The side of greens was an ideal accompaniment, with a light vinaigrette. The entrees, on the other hand, were so disappointing... The veal marsala was meh: while it was tender enough to cut with a fork, the sauce was very generic, almost tasted like brown gravy, which is exactly what ny husband said about the sauce on his ahi tuna dish. As far as the sides of potatoes & veggies that came with the meals--on par with your average cafeteria, and unfortunately, there was no salt nor pepper on the table to remedy the absolute blandness. By the time the waitress got back to our table, I had decided not to bother requesting seasonings, as they were already cold.
The dessert (chocolate cheesecake) was passable, but tasted prepackaged.

I didn't even want to tell him about the busted chalula and my foot being hurt by their bags.  They finally did replace the missing items, but only after making me cry and keeping me from using my phone and taking my drivers license.  I felt threatened and unsafe.

 I would say if you go there, double check and make sure all your bags get in your cart, ask for double bagging and if they short your order go back with a big guy as a body guard or something.  They are scary there and they do not take complaints well.

I walked in to find just one couple eating their food.  The aroma coming from the kitchen welcomed me and as soon as I opened the menu, I knew that they were serious about their Vietnamese food.

I ordered the fresh shrimp and chicken spring rolls, which come with a delicious peanut sauce. 

My main order was of the seafood Pho which consisted of big delectable shrimp, squid, fried fish cakes, and crab meat (imitation, but still yummy) in a rich and flavorful pork broth.  I wanted to try something different, so I chose the yummy pork broth, as opposed to the normal beef broth.  I also had them combine two different types of noodles for me, ramen and clear ones.  The combination of the various flavors and noodles, really enhanced the meal.  I also enjoyed a cold Sapporo beer, which for happy hour was only $2.00.

I'm just getting around to Yelping it now, but I doubt anything drastic has changed. 

Me and a buddy of mine were trying to travel very cheaply. We camped out as much as possible, but decided to splurge on the $40 hotel here in Tempe. We didn't have much of a choice as it hit 110 degrees during the day and was a cool 85 at night. My expectations for a hotel are fairly basic in my opinion:

1. Clean enough to not find multiple bugs, have nasty smells, or stains anywhere.

2. Have a bed.

3. Have air conditioning (at least in Arizona in August)

The only thing that this Days Inn got right was having a bed in the room. But it wasn't even good enough to satisfy rule #1!!!

The receptionist wasn't very friendly when we checked in, but I could overlook this small feature. Again, it's not high on my list when I pay $40 for a room. After driving around to where our room was, it looked nice enough at first glance. We were just happy to have a place to get out of the furnace that was the outdoors. After getting inside, we crank the a/c full blast. Ahhhhh, finally some relief.... or so we thought. We waited for a while for it to cool down, but in the mean time all we could do was strip down to our underwear and just lie on the beds. But it never did start to cool down. It was just blowing some warm air. Strike #1.

Waiting for it to turn night so we could actually move around without breaking a sweat, we were watching some tv and I noticed a few crickets jumping around on the comforter on the bed. WTF? Strike #2

We decided to go out later that night because we had heard the Tempe nightlife was pretty good. It was all going good until we called it a night and came back to the hotel. We wake up early in the morning to check out and the bathroom is completely infested with ants all over the sink. Crawling over our toothbrushes, the towels, up and down the walls, we had had enough. Strike #3

I've never had problems with other Days Inn in the past, but I guess not every franchise has the same owners and rules. Definitely avoid this place like the plague.",review,1,lClvoNr2cNYM6hC_rG7yEg

I've been to the miniature golf course probably 4 or 5 times. What can I say? I like me some mini golf! Reminds me of Ocean City, MD where I spent many of my summers as a kid! 

Anyways, there are two mini golf courses of 19 holes each. One is the Lost Dutchman and I forget the exact name of the other one, but it has to do with a Princess. Both are rather elaborate with obstacles and props to correspond with the theme. Watch out for the windmill and loop-de-loop. I had some trouble with them and racked up a few etra strokes trying to finish the hole. :) I also ended up with my ball in the water once or twice, but I like to keep the game interesting! 

I like to go to this location around sunset like between 6 -7 p.m. The view is very pretty with an orange streaked show passing through the sky. Once it becomes dark, the course becomes more vibrant as colored lights and large white spotlights turn on, so you can play in the dark. 

Good for a small group of people. More than 4 or 5 would seem to take too long for each person to finish. I think 2 -4 would be the perfect group size.

For my entree I had the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps, (stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and green onions with three dipping sauces and shiitake & portabella mushrooms), also very good, and healthy!! My friend ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which had a mushroom sauce, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them! For Dessert I had the Youngberry Chocolate which is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's chocolate Stout together (since both were delicious, I had to try them together, naturally). Prices ranged from reasonable to pretty expensive, the drinks were definitely in the very expensive range, as reflected in our well over $100 tab..

No, RA is not the best sushi restaurant in town. No, it is not the most authentic. But it always draws me back in. The happy hour, the drinks (Umami Punch, you are my liquid soulmate), the special rolls...I can't help myself. (""I wish I knew how to quit you""...)

We had a bottle of pinot, which was good for cheap wine, not great but hey for the price who's complaining. We had rice pudding and mango sorbet for dessert and they were both delicious. My only complaint was our server. She wasn't bad per se, just not overly friendly. She seemed somewhat annoyed, likely because she had to work on New Years Eve, but hey, not my problem. I definitely recommend Bombay spice for something different and for a nice atmosphere.",review,0,p6Os13EIOkUOUK5pzd0-ag

Well, I'm clearly missing something here.  This is the second ""Joe's"" restaurant I've been to now and I remain less than impressed.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't OMFG great either.

So we had a caprese sandwich and what they called a liberty sandwich.

Ok so for the caprese sandwich.  Cheese, good.  Tomato, good.  Basil, good.   Bread, not good.  For whatever reason they toasted the bread to the point of it being a crouton.  Really??  It was supposed to be a panini type sandwich, but it comes out like a crouton??  For all the hype behind this place you'd think they could toast a piece of bread.  I mean I can and I don't even run a restaurant.

Ok, on to the liberty sandwich, which is actually a turkey sandwich with green apples, candied walnuts, bleu cheese and red pepper aioli.  Good news, they didn't toast the bread so it actually came out pretty good.  Turkey was good.  As for the combination of all the ingredients...not so much.  I get someone sat down and put this all together and somewhere along the line thought it was a good idea but in reality, too many competing textures, too many competing flavors.

Both sandwiches came with potato salad...not bad...but I didn't come here to eat potato salad.

Now having said the above, the place was as busy as a Greyhound bus terminal (lunch time).  So is this place as good as everyone says it is?  Or is it me?  Here's what I'm thinking, it's just ok.  People give it way more credit because it's in the old part of Gilbert and as such makes it extra ""cool.""

I didn't want to get any further into my review without declaring my warning up close and personal. From start to finish my recent experience with Paesano was atrocious. First, I called to ask if they had a website since I would be ordering a lot of food for a work event and the guy gave me a website that doesn't exist. When I told him it didn't work he raised his voice in a ""are you stupid tone""? He repeated the spelling of the website which still didn't exist so I finally asked for him to fax a copy of the menu.

When I placed the order the next day I asked if they include paper plates and utensils to which he replied in the same ""are you stupid tone"" ""uhhh why would we do that? People either eat in our restaurant or they take the food home where they have plates and forks there.""  OK...

When I arrived to pick up the food at 4:00 like I said I would, no one was at the front counter.  An entire five minutes goes by and still no one.  So, I called the restaurant from INSIDE the restaurant until someone came out to acknowledge me. Turned out to be the same gruff guy from the phone who appeared to be the owner and manager.  Nothing was ready...not even the side salads. He disappeared and spent another 10 minutes preparing the food which came out to extremely small portions for the price.  I mean, each little ravioli cost around $2 a piece!  When he went to ring me up the final kicker ensued.  First, he charged me for 9 entrees when I ordered 7.  When I asked him to go over the itemized receipt he said ""what, you don't trust me?""  Ummm...hello...NO turns out I shouldn't trust you at all since you overcharged me for 2 invisible meals!  Then, without apologizing for his mistake, he rang me up again and this time charged me $1000.06 for my 7 meals. You read that  correctly - one THOUSAND dollars.  When I looked at the credit card bill before signing I pointed out his error and he replied ""No, it says 100 dollars.""  To which I was blown away.  I practically had to shove the bill in his face for him to accept his mistake.  Finally, 20 minutes after I was supposed to have left I finally had my overly priced food and paid the correct amount.

with a rather interesting schmorgasboard of breakfast ingredients from chunks of fruit to odd yogurt parfaits into omelette's & french toast sticks. 
it wasn't half bad with all its open air patio out front. plus, the view from where we sat was incredible with the 300+ bikes parked just to the North of the building.
  
   my 2nd visit. yielded a Friday Night definetly worth going back for more if you were interested in singles speed dating with a mix of DJ house music & live performances on stage with a house band between sets. good mixed crowd of both characters & those worthy of a glance.

  my 3rd visit. was during an interesting stage of ""am i in Tempe?""
confuscious says. Saturday nights, are Hip-Hop/Rap & R with B styles. And unless you are sporting 22's on Pirelli's with the chrome &  or gold stretched across your neck. or possibly you are an up-in-coming future hall-of-music, yo MTV raps or some other prospective lover of everything which has become American G-Rap... this is the spot to show your shoes.

 i give Sugar & the Daddy's an A++ for the Bouncer's Decorative
 T-shirts, their wise-cracking staff & the overall appeal.

i give its buffett a three thumbs down & go find a La Peep breakfast restaurant instead.

 and its Friday Nights a gotta give it a go kind of attitude.

After going to college in Tucson, where there were all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants galore, I felt really deprived moving back to Peoria. This is the closest thing I could find on the northwest part of the valley. 
Yes, as my friend once complained, it does smell like fish when you walk into the restaurant, but that's to be expected. It's an Asian seafood buffet! 
I think I have been here about 4-5 times, and I still haven't gotten sick yet. I'll be honest. There's been days where the sashimi has been really fresh like around 5pm today (a Sunday), but during the weekdays, there has been times when it hasn't been as fresh. It's just a gamble I guess, but I feel like it's best to come on a Sunday now. They seems to switch the variety of sushi rolls too each time I've been there.
Today, since it was Sunday, there was a lot of variety of cooked food too. There was stuffed crab, roasted duck, stuffed shrimp, roast beef, and crab legs. They had steak that could be cooked upon ordering. There was also a variety of Korean, Chinese and Japaneses noodles as well as some Dim Sum favorites. My dad ate mussels and fried frog legs if you can believe it. The mussels I understand, but I was pretty surprised they had fried frog legs. Disclaimer: my family will eat almost anything and everything - I guess one could call us ""taste adventurers."" 
The variety of desserts was okay. They had carrot cake squares, bland flan, and bread pudding. They always carry green tea ice cream, which is pretty good. 
I'm praising the variety of food as you can tell. I'm not praising how amazing the food is. The food is overall just good for what it's worth. It cost about $55 for the three of us: my dad, my husband, and I to stuff our faces and go into food comas.

Highlights: 
- Atmosphere: islandy calm and relaxing fun. Everything smells like pineapple and coconut. Big bar area upstairs, patio downstairs, as well as open window patio upstairs as well are nice seating options. 
- Blackened fish sandwich: white fish cooked well and slightly crispy on the seasoned top. Only thing is I could have used some more spice. I appreciated the soft, slightly sweet grilled bun as well as the pairing with the refreshing cucumber tomato salad. 
- Cocktails: huge menu list of fun mixology and tropical items 
- Bread: big hat-shaped hunk of soft and warm yeasty goodness 
- Desserts: the tray always looks enticing especially the pina colada cake, but I usually don't have room. I do like that they have a half portion option for a smaller taste. 

Lowlights: 
- Pork sandwich: sauce was way too sweet and I like sweet bbq. The southern hub couldn't even finish it.

I always get the falafel platter, or plate, or whatever.  It comes with falafel, fluffy rice, and lemon baked potatoes.  It also comes with a greek salad, a tub of tahini, and some pita slices.

What I don't like: the greek salad comes utterly covered in sauce and feta.  As in, the entire top of the salad is white.  I realize this is a mega-bonus for some, but I avoid dairy, so I normally just give the salad away or sub it for fries, which are very good.  Everything else in the salad is fresh and crisp.  I also really don't like the tahini...or, I think it's tahini.  It is super sharp and heavy tasting, not really what I'm used to in the tahini-department, and is really thick.  Spackle-thick.

The potatoes are amazing.  So very good.  I asked if they use butter in them and got an answer of ""probably not.""  Not quite the answer I'm looking for, but I agree - probably not.  The pitas are fresh and delicious.  The falafel is always pretty good.

This isn't a first date kind of place - there must be a clause in the Long Wong franchise that stipulates that any Long Wongs needs to be a complete and utter dive. I've never seen a single reputable looking LW establishment, but don't let the appearance deceive you - Long Wongs is a diamond in the rough.

The piece de resistance of every Long Wongs is their chicken wings. I'd like to believe that nowhere else on the planet could you find a more perfect blend of crispy, saucy, tasty wings. I've never had wings anywhere else that came close to being as good. I've tried most of their flavors, but my favorite is Honey Mustard. It's a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, sticky goodness. Other great flavors are Teriyaki, Honey BBQ, Honey Hot, and Medium.  

I've had their deep fried zucchinis, mushrooms, and their corn dogs (Foster Farms) and they're all delicious.

A dozen wings for $7-8 bucks isn't a bad deal at all. I've done larger orders for family get-togethers and work potlucks and the wings consistently get rave reviews. If you want good wings, you're not going to find anything better and you'll only end up paying more, save yourself the trouble and go to Long Wongs.

I'd recommend phoning in your order ahead of time otherwise it can be a 10 minute wait (and make sure you have the correct location).

If you can get over the fact that the restaurant looks like (and actually is) a shack, you'll be delighted at what they serve up. It's certainly worth a try, and I doubt they'll disappoint.",review,2,8EqtxOnG0j0BwKpSDwDHbA

When ordering we requested something simple, like adding cottage cheese to scrambled eggs, in order to make it softer for the baby to eat. We were told that the ""boss"" didn't like to make changes to the menu but she would ask. They did end up doing it but when they brought it out, it was unbelievable, it looked like they'd added a whole pint of cottage cheese to one egg. They redid it and it was just okay. With all of the competition in Scottsdale you would think that they would do all they could to make a customer happy.  I probably will think twice about bringing my business back to this restaurant. This restaurant needs to work on their customer service & their attitudes. Their food is good, except for the pancakes, which are dry and fall apart when you cut into them.  Altogether a disappointing experience.",review,0,acEb_NmXCFLSxAp55aCmig

Brunch/Lunch: HUGE portions... I mean HUGE! I had an ahi tuna wrap (I know, totally non-western) and it was decent; a little tastless, but fresh and filling. I also tried the garlic mashed taters and they were good, but not anything to rave about. The service was awful, but the manager made up for it by bringing our entire table free shots and enormous plates of dessert. The shots were basically flavored water, but the desserts were moist, rich brownies with lots of ice cream.

Friday night: The place was packed with an odd mix in the crowd. You had sports fans, mixed with tourists, mixed with silicone. It was so busy and we had such a large group (friend's birthday) that I was able to tune out the urge to people watch. Didn't eat much, but the wait staff was much more attentive. What's odd is that we got free shots again (at 2 separate tables from different waiters) and free dessert. I noticed a trend that most of the wait staff was delivering trays of shots to the various tables. Our table of women were also approached by the bull-ride conductor (is that what you would call him?) and told that we'd get free rides if we could muster up the courage to hop on the saddle.

This place gives you complimentary chips + salsa + bean dip. The chips are crispy, fresh and tasty. The salsa and bean dip are not anything exceptional.

I tried the supreme nachos. It could've been better. They definitely put lots of toppings and meat on it. I felt like it was very greasy (but I expected it to be). It can be soggy near the end of the dish because all the cheese and meat soaks in it. The beef is just ground beef. Everything is stuck together so sometimes it is hard to share. It does come with a lot of ingredients on top like sour cream, guac, jalapenos.

The cheese crisp is interesting. It reminds me of a tortilla pizza with just cheese on it. Nothing exceptional. 

Service is mediocre. I think since our party was big, it was difficult for the waiters to see what's going on. They tried to refill our drinks but they weren't always on top of everything.

I had oral surgery yesterday and I went in to the store because there was 6 cars waiting for the drive-thru and this is the only pharmacy even close to my house.  After waiting in line 10 minutes just to drop off my prescription, the guy could notice I was in a great deal of pain and said he'd get my prescription filled within 15 minutes.  I decided to sit in the waiting area and suffer in silence.

First off, I can't believe the authorities allow them to sell medical supplies, treat patients (they have a little doctor's office in back) or fill prescriptions here.  This place is a disgusting mess.  There were 3 chairs available for me to sit in, one had garbage on it, one had what I can only describe as a ""snail trail"" on it and one was tucked in the corner under some advertisements and next to the busy staff door.  After wedging myself into the only ""clean"" chair I started the long painful wait at Walgreens.  Once I left the store, I wanted to take off all my clothes in the parking lot and burn them right there.  I had the worst case of the heebeegeebees and didn't want to take that filth home with me.  ewwwww!!!  

Now, I understand that they're busy and that other people too are in pain or need meds urgently.  I also understand that they have no control over the wackos that they let in the door and that they can't shut up that kid who is screaming and throwing a fit.  But they could at least, at very minimum, be somewhat accurate with how long they tell you it'll be.  I wouldn't have waited if they told me it was going to take 40 minutes.  I don't think I would've waited if they told me 20 minutes.  And from here on out, I won't wait at all, no matter my condition.

There actually was a table of Frenchmen doing such on my second visit! 

Inside the tables have bright flowers in little vases. (see attached photo) Annnnnd there was a chalk elephant and monkey on the floor! Art house oils on the walls enhance the aesthetics. It just has this simple and wonderful charm. 

There were whole fresh strawberries embedded in my muffin. So goooood. It had those flaky crumbles on the top too. In front of the pastries are little placards. They have descriptives like ""elegant"" or ""scrumptious"". The owner smiled and said his girlfriend is in PR and she's responsible for that. I thought it was beyond endearing. 

The owner, in fact, is really amiable. He asked my friend and me if we'd like to see the patio. It's not ready yet for sitting... But! He plans to paint it ""terracotta like"", plant some bougainvillea, buy some hotel valley ho inspired umbrellas, plus misters for the summertime. I absolutely cannot wait. 

Oh! The Iced Toddy was pretty damn good. It had complex nutty and chocolate undertones.

It's such a shell of its former self. 
The escalators are blocked off, so you must stair it up to the second level. The concession and theaters on the first floor are not used, it appears. Perhaps for bigger fest events they're put to use?
We came to see Black Dynamite, but it took us several minutes to find the theater where it was playing. There was a random movie in one, a poetry slam in another, and no one - from the concession workers to the ticket worker - could tell us where it was. We eventually found it on our fourth try.
A friend got some popcorn and I was floored when he said they didn't have butter for it. Wha? It's just ... dry popcorn? That's been prob sitting there for a few hours? What's the point? I know, it's better for you without the ""butter flavoring,"" but an artery-clogging, movie-going staple!
So, all this sounds like I don't care for MADCAP, but that's not true. I love what they're doing, and I'll take a bare bones, butter-free operation to get my fill of cult classics, random indie greats, John Hughes fests, horror fests, b-flicks and more any day. And thank god someone is using that space - there's so much abandoned space and so many empty dirt lots in PHX it's just fucking embarrassing.

I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!

Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.

Weeknights are great. This is the place to lounge around on their beautiful patio with a glass of wine(or three) and amazing small plates. A great spot for warm summer nights. Service was impeccable and prices were perfect. Plus the staff actually know their stuff when it comes to their wines and what to recommend. 

But then there's the weekend...
Made the mistake of taking the husband on a Friday night and we didn't even stay for a drink. Apparently this is THE place for the Chandler cougar crowd and the 40-50 somethings acting like bnoxious 20 year olds. I hate to generalize but when you walk in and get the stink eye from three 60 yr old ladies in mini skirts, it hardly encourages affection. We walked in and the place was packed. It's a bar on a weekend, that's to be expected. But there was no one around with a wait list, and the place isn't set up to have a lobby or really even a host stand. All I could assume was that it was a free for all seating plan and we didn't feel like wading through the mob of  soccer dads in affliction shirts to try to reach the bar. 

Definitely can't recommend on the weekend, and if you do attempt it, keep in mind that there is absolutely nothing else in the area as far as bars or nightlife so you may be stuck trekking it into Chandler or Tempe to find something else to do.

I got a regular hot dog with mild garlic mayo and mango. So, so good. The mayo still had a bit of kick to it even though it was mild and the fruit relish was sweet and tasty. The perfect balance. The dog itself was huge and had a good beefy flavor. And the bun was nice and fresh which can really make or break a hot dog. They also serve tots and fries. Awesome!

I was in the mood for my favorite Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers so the husband and I stopped by after a little bit of b-day shopping for my mom.  This location is weird.  There were a couple weeks a couple months ago where I swear this place wasn't open.  No lights, no misters, no cars, nothing.  It was really strange.  It was definitely open this time.  

We were immediately greeted by a middle aged guy, who I felt sorry for but what can you do in this economy, and were seated in the upstairs portion at a ridiculously long table/bench area with enough seating for 8.  That type of seating arrangement is really awkward when there is only two people dining.  Our waitress was good, serving us our drinks really quickly and refilling them without asking.  The food was fantastic, in terms of sauced up chicken fingers.  I love the sweet/smoky/spicy flavor of the sauce, the chicken is always juicy and the fries and corn area always tasty.  I can't really complain about anything.

I take that back, I can complain about the booth directly across from me.  There were two adults and a two year old.  The two adults were very clearly deaf.  They were using sign language and I was not so discreetly staring at them intently, fascinated by the sign language.  However, their child started screaming at the top of his lungs at one point.  I don't know how they missed the vibrations in the air right next to them, but they didn't do anything to shush him.  Oh well, I'm not at some fine-dining establishment, so I guess you have to expect it.  This is a good Chili's.",review,5,W_QXYA7A0IhMrvbckz7eVg

Venezuelan food is that type of food that you either love very much or find no pleasure in eating it. This is also a type of food that you can find restaurants galore in Miami, New york City and L.A. 

I have several Venezuelan friends so I know exactly what a good Arepa tastes like, or a cachapa, hallacas, empanadas, etc. 

I decided to go to My Arepa because I had been craving for some Arepas and cachapas so I decided to pick up my mom and went to try this place. 

The place looks okay!! As long as it looks pretty clean, I am okay with the rest. So this place looked clean to me. 

I ordered a Parchita (Passion fruit drink). It was good and refreshing. $3 

Then, I ordered Arepas (one of queso de mano-soft cheese and another one of Shredded beef). $4 each! They were okay but please agree with me that the price is too high for an arepa!!! 

My mom ordered a cheese and ham empanda for $4 and an arepa. 

I ordered cachapas (sweet corn cakes) for my kids. They are sweet and fluffy. I ordered them with soft cheese for $6 each! They were good but the price is TOO high!! These are probably the most expensive Cachapas I've eaten in my life. Not even in L.A. or Miami were that expensive...why is that? I don't know yet!! 

And lastly, I ordered Hallacas to go (a tamal like cake filled with all kinds of vegetables and wrapped in banana leaves). They were $8 each and I must say that I've eaten better ones. They usually sell them frozen to go because it is my understanding that someone from Florida makes them for the owner. So they are not fresh and it is obvious!!! 

Overall, the place is good but I would only go back if I am really craving Venezuelan food and don't feel like cooking it myself. The prices are outrageous I think. I also double check with my Venezuelan friends and they also think the prices are high!!!",review,3,flMTJnE1mA8HDFV_qRafpA

Restaurants lower their prices during this 7-day period (a three-course meal runs you $29 per person) in order to gain new customers and fill spots during less-popular dining times. At places like Lon's or Cowboy Ciao, guests end up getting meals that would normally cost $50 or more per person for a mere $29. Knowing that I got a much-more expensive meal at a bit of a discount definitely makes me want to give Lon's a higher rating. 

At the same time, however, my husband and I were discussing that we would have been disappointed with our experience *had we paid* twice the price. And since people reading this review may not have the good fortune of going to Lon's during the RW, when prices are lower than normal, I'm going to have to give the restaurant 3 stars. This is based on the food not being that flavorful or impressive given the prices they normally charge. 

We started the meal with Absolut martinis, which were pricey at $12 each and contained vermouth even though we asked for them ""dry."" Since we, just like Joel L, thought that spare ribs was a strange starter but both wanted to try them, we decided to pick a starter off the regular menu. We both love duck, so we ordered the salad with the seared duck. It wasn't great. We liked that it had pine nuts but found the dressing to be overwhelming acidic and were disappointed by the four pepperoni-shaped, paper-thin, and bland-tasting duck pieces. 

The disappointment continued with the spare ribs. I loved the sweet potato puree that accompanied them but found the ribs themselves to be a bit dry and not all that flavorful. The ""carrot jus"" was not detectable (or if it was, didn't add much), and we were dismayed to see that the listing for the same ribs on the regular menu said that the meat came with ""ancho chile chocolate sauce."" How sad that the RW version of the ribs didn't have the opportunity to be dressed up in a more flavorful sauce!

For my entree, I ordered the pan-roasted scallops with the roasted pepper spaetzle, organic spinach, and the corn jus. My husband doesn't care for scallops much, but I found them to be well-cooked and not too metallic or gritty (as bad scallops can be). The sides, especially the spaetzle, were interesting and pretty flavorful. I could definitely taste that the spinach was organic. I also had a glass of wine with my entree and did appreciate the pairings listed on the RW menu next to each course, which made it easy to quickly choose an appropriate wine.  

My husband had the open-faced shrimp ravioli. We both loved the concept and again, found the vegetables to be really fresh and tender. However, we didn't taste anything resembling lobster jus and found the shrimp to be pretty over-cooked. The portion was small, which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful, but that wasn't really the case here. 

In terms of desserts, the lemon tarte was just ok (and actually reminded me of those lemon bars you make from a boxed mix), but the chocolate truffle torte with the minted berries was outstanding. Since we weren't blown away by any of the other dishes we had tried, it was really nice to end the meal with a delicious, rich dessert. 

I am glad to have had a romantic meal in a beautiful patio setting for only $29 per person, but again, we would have been quite disappointed with Lon's food had we gone and paid regular prices for everything ($25+ for the shrimp ravioli would have been the most disappointing).  That being said, I can't reiterate how peaceful and unique the patio setting is, and the service was certainly professional and attentive (the bus boys did an especially nice job of keeping the table clean and re-filling water glasses). The atmosphere and service may make me want to go back at some point (maybe on someone else's dime!) and give Lon's food another try. 

One final note - Lon's does take reservations through OpenTable.com although the email confirmation requested that we call the restaurant directly in order to secure patio seating, so I would suggest making direct contact with the restaurant if it really matters to you to sit on the patio.",review,8,HOleI3jz1MLNUJ6cc1x0Pw

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.",review,2,OpUXG69nP4YjlEZDlkdVcQ

I don't really know what else to say. You can sing the praises of any burger joint in town, but I haven't come across one that beats the flavor or the au poivre II - juicy beef, big enough for two, cracked peppercorns, thick cut bacon, wine sautéed onions plus blue cheese... it is a brilliant combination and has never disappointed, and I rarely even order a burger. 

If you would prefer to skip the beef the AZ88 chicken is doused in buffalo sauce served on a bun with blue cheese (everything should be served with blue cheese) and is a great choice. If you'd like to forgo the beef and the bun, the AZ88 salad offers the same spicy buffalo chicken breast on top of the already well devised Four Season's salad, which offers a nice mix of fresh ingredients beyond your basic lettuces and tomatoes. 

You can't review AZ88 without discussing the cocktails - well you could, but it would be a shame to overlook these tasty little concoctions. Actually, ""little"" isn't a word I would use to describe the adult beverages here. AZ88's martinis are legendary for their size. I've heard complaints about the cost of the drinks here, but you are getting a lot of bang for your buck in that martini glass. The liquid tests the laws of viscosity and your waiter's balance as it makes its way to your table. It is a real challenge to see if you can pick it up from the table in a smooth enough manner to keep all the liquid in the glass. My favorite stolen from AZ88 cocktail trick is to make cubes of frozen juices and cover them in vodka - no mixing required! This makes me look super slick when I have a party (shhh).

I just recently found out AZ88 is dog friendly on the patio, which just makes me love them all the more. I have a feeling my Italian greyhound will be a big fan of the burger and will also appreciate the fact that it's way too much for me to eat on my own.",review,3,mE2ll6yfwUvy-W7To3E0AQ

After my wonderful five hr drive with two dogs, one of which pees every hour or two i arrived in the sunny camelback corridor having not eaten all day and needing a drink.  My good buddy suggested that we go to a new Italian joint that had opened around the corner. 

I felt slightly awkward going in wearing cut off shorts and a t-shirt as people were relatively nicely dresses, whats a guy going to do, i just drove five hrs and my money is green too. The hostess was a miserable human, scowling and not in the least bit friendly... now look, three guys in t-shirts and long hair, i get it, you think they are going to order water and three of the cheapest entrees but that doesn't mean you have to be obnoxious.  The restaurant itself has a romantic red tinted ambiance, typical white table cloths and a nice stone wall.  Each table is brought an assortment of french bread, focaccia, spicey peppers in oil, and herb butter.  The home made herb butter was actually one of the best things they served, it was the perfect blend of basil, garlic and s&p.

Wine-wise i got a bottle of the caldora sangiovese that was exceptional, a nice light fruity red.  We started out with the Zucchini fritte, the presentation was surprisingly original, the zuc was shaved into shoestrings and  lightly battered, served in a large bowl garnished with lemons. It was good but if i had my way the acidic nature of the fried veg would have been paired with a lemon aioli or anything stiffer than just lemon to cut through the heartiness of the battered zuc. As was everything at Aiello's the portion was more than the three of us could consume.

For our entrees we had the Oso Buco special, Gnocchi Pesto and a chicken ceas. The oso buco was good, it was served with TWO shanks, stewed veg and a bed of parpadelle.  I am a firm believer of quality over quantity, and while the meat was good it was by no means perfect. The outsides were fall off the bone tender but the further you got in the more tough it got, there is NO reason any human being needs to eat two veal shanks. Also, i prefer veal to be served over a creamy sage or spiced polenta as pasta can be heavy and flavorless (no sauce just the veg and veal jus) especially since it is hard to eat pasta with bites of meat. The gnocchi was good, the pesto was mild and they had tossed it with pine nuts, nothing revolutionary flavor-wise.  The ceas looked good, didn't try it, but it too was more than could be finished. 

During our entire service the the owner/head chef circled the dinning room haranguing guests and post-bill playing Italian ""pick a number"" for a free meal. Now during the meal he asked every table BUT the three guys in t-shirts with goofy hair how their food was, how their evening was going, etc. Look i get you think this is a classy place and what are these three punks doing in here but after an app, three entrees and a bottle you might think he would realize we're no ""water and bread shmucks."" No big deal, i had no pressing need to talk to him but apparently when the bill is presented it is mandatory to play his ""pick a number game"", every other table got a speech and epic fanfare but when it came to us we got a terse ""pick a number 'tween 1-100, get a free meal 'cept yah booze"" ... hahaha Alright, if you are going to turn your nose up at some guys in t-shirts then ditch the pick a number, it isn't charming and is definitely not classing up the joint.  Oh, also, since your kitchen is open onto the dining room, can you NOT stand in the dinning room yelling at cooks, it echos through the entire restaurant and is pretty awkward. 

If you have ever watched the Sopranos there is a series of shows where Vesuvios (Artie Bucco's restaurant where the family oft gathers) is doing poorly and Tony suggest it is because Artie is an over anxious, fawning host who interjects himself into everyone's conversations while hanging over guests whilst they eat. This should be no owner/chef/manager's model and while Aiello's owner is not THAT extreme he seems to be heading down the same road.  People come to eat, enjoy each other's company and relax.. try something a little more subtle like a digestif compliments of the chef or a handshake and inquiry about the food when delivering the bill.

Came across Jamburritos at the Phoenix Public Farmers' Market on a Saturday morning. Now with all those food options around (Hey Joe, Short Leash, etc.) you may ask what made me pick this one (besides the heat); Catfish! I hadn't had catfish (scratch that, good catfish) in quite sometime. 

I had a couple options for the catfish; grilled or fried/sandwich or bowl. Over a couple of visits, I have all the combinations. There is no wrong way to have Chef Michael Brown's catfish. 

The catfish was perfect, and what I mean by that is: 
- Perfectly cooked, tender and flaky 
- spiced perfectly (wife finds it a little hot for her, but still tastes so good she is willing to endure) :) 

If they don't have the catfish, I usually go for a chicken jamburrito with rice, andouille sausage, pepper jack cheese, and lettuce. The make a great red/hot sauce you can put on any of the menu and kick the heat up a notch. 

Lastly, can't forget to mention the hushpuppies. I consider myself a foodie, but I eat these little deep-fried puffs so fast that I don't take anytime to figure out what is in them. I know for sure though, they are NOT like any hushpuppies you have had before (oh so good).

I originally chose Alkyd paint because it is lower in VOC's than other oil paints but as they run out I am going to start using acrylics so this is not really an inconvenience at all. 

But they DO carry Golden Open Acrylics brand which are ""slow drying acrylics"" as opposed to the Alkyds which are ""fast drying oils"" if you happen to be looking for something in that middle ground.

Cheddar Cheese Fondue (This was amazing, with a beer base...cheese and beer...come on HEAVEN)

Cog Au Vin Entree Broth (utterly amazing)

Barro's pizza is second to none. At least for me that is. It isn't my wife's favorite but she knows I like it so much that she takes one for the team for my sake. All of the pizzas I have had from pepperoni to the works type are very good. Fresh, good ingredients, a little more sauce than other pizza joints make for an awesome pie. Please don't go here and buy a salad. That would completely negate the awesome which is waiting to be made for you.

The other options are also rather good as well. The wings are not my favorite but they are still very good. They are bigger than most wings in the area and the sauce is thicker and stickier than comparable wings as well. They aren't the style I usually prefer but they are big and meaty nonetheless. The flavor is good and the heat is predictable depending on the grade you select. The salad bar always has fresh ingredients if that is your persuasion. I have had one before and they have some good dressings as well. Thankfully, my wife really likes to eat the salad while I devour the pizza she doesn't care for very much.

No worries, pad it with bar naps and duct tape the shit out of it. Fixed. Get er done.

I had a bad experience with the food but a great one with the employees. 

After receiving a very nice letter from one of the managers (or owner, not quite sure) I returned to give Lobby's another shot. For the first round I got the Italian Beef sandwich. Here's the rundown:

1. Beef was very very tender and there was no fat present. It just fell apart. Lovely.
2. Very, very salty. I stopped eating everything except the beef because of this, and I still refilled my drink twice.
3. The bun withstood the juice much better then the hot dog bun had. I was pleased.

So as far as that goes, I dunno. It would have been better if there wasn't so much salt. I give it a C+.

But because at this point I had tried a hot dog, and a sandwich I figured I should at least try the burger before writing this place off (again). 

Good decision!

The burger was fantastic. Run down:

1.The beef was perfectly cooked (and seasoned). 
2.The lettuce was crisp and fresh, the tomatoes were thick cut and fresh. 
3.The grilled onions were amazing.

I took one bite and realized that Lobby's Beefy burgers are amazing. And I would definitely return for one of these. I give the burger an A+.

And as always, the service was nice and friendly.

So if you just want a good burger, and don't care about the other stuff (fries looked good but I didn't get any), Lobby's may be a good choice. But if you want a hot dog or sandwich it may be best to get that somewhere else.

Boston Market on a Friday night, thought I'd stop by for some quick comfort food before heading to the movies. It was not busy but they way they handled everything you would have thought it was packed. 

They must have some new employee issues because I got one taking my order. I ordered a carver sandwich. My child ordered mac and cheese of course. It seemed to be a language barrier when I said Brisket carver sandwich on WHEAT. She repeated back to me three times insisting I do the combo. Ok maybe it only comes as a combo so I say yes. She tells the cook  ""half beef on white"" and I quickly correct her. WHEAT please.  

Some sort of holdup and they say they will bring to it to the table for us.  We get our Mac N Cheese and drinks and sit. A few minutes later the 1/2 carver arrived wrapped and ready togo.  No au jus for dipping. No salad. Just a 1/2 sandwich. She says ""I'm sorry"" and realizes she forgot the rest of the order and quickly goes back to get the missing food. The manager comes by and asks what is wrong as he is apologizing to every table. He was the manager of ""I'm sorry"". She comes back with the food and leaves. The sandwich had 2 small skinny pieces of beef on it that did not even cover the roll. No swiss and no mayo. The au jus was warm at best. The salad was fine. I was extremely disappointed in the carver sandwich. For $6 I do think there should be meat on the sandwich. 

To be quite honest the last few times I have been to this location they are slipping. It will be a few months before I go back if I ever go back. The manager did bring me a one free corn muffin. Hint hint...Nice jester but dessert would have been better. 

Just very disappointed in the whole experience.",review,1,PA3ztLFGwZgbV_q1FqwcAA

In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the ""calamari"" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.

The sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. 

The meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling ""Extra! Extra!""

Constructed in 1976 with good intentions, the 2.5 acre park was never a success. A charming amphitheatre looks like it would be perfect for a small jazz concert or other musical event, but to date I have never heard of a single concert playing here. Despite its location in the heart of our city's financial district, no downtown professionals I know ever spend any time there except to scurry past the bums, who've taken it over, to the elevators, which take them to the underground parking structure for the nearby courts and other buildings. It is, or was, to be avoided both day and night. The homeless have always run the place. Although the city cleaned and maintained it regularly, it still smelled like pee. If you dared to walk through it at night, you'd see cockroaches running before every step you took. It was nasty. 

When the plan to demolish it for the new Cityscape project was proposed, some community activists put up a major fuss in protest. I don't know why and I don't care. I live in downtown Phoenix. I have taken 100% of my assets and hard-earned savings and invested them in this area. I'm here for the long haul, and I used my vote and my voice to support the new plans. 

Patriots Park is no longer fully accessible, as it has been fenced off for future demolition.  Many people who grew up in Phoenix have nostalgic feelings about the place, because in its heyday I'm sure it was a much different experience. But it simply hasn't worked out in the long run.

I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  

There was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  

The shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  

Ginger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  

Lastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   

It wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  

Does 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.

Sure, there are a few things I would change if I could, but I cannot give this place less than five stars. 

Right when you walk into the Saguaro, the colors and design work will blow you away. I checked in on Saturday and got here way earlier than the normal check-in time, but when I got to the front desk I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it wasn't a problem! The girl working at the desk was so nice and asked me to wait about ten minutes and she'd have a room for me. She followed through on her word, and a few minutes later I had a bottle of water in hand from the valet guys and was making my way to my room. Since I was recovering from a cold and had a long morning of travel, I was so happy to be so close to a bed.

I was totally blown away by my room. It's absolutely huge and beautiful, and the bright colors & cool designs pop. The king size bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, and the balcony is nice when I want to get a bit of fresh air. The bathroom leaves a bit to be desired, but you can't have it all I suppose. The robes are unbelievably comfortable, and the true comfort of this room is so appreciated. Also, there's a Kuerig in here with a variety of K-Cups. Yes please.

The room service menu from Distrito is ridiculous. When I got here, I ordered guac, chicken tacos, and a plantain app, and everything was so flavorful and well-made. The breakfast is pretty good, too. Employees are more than friendly and do what they can to make you happy & comfortable.

I have only two small complaints... well, more just things to be aware of. The hotel was having some sort of pool party on Saturday from 12-6, and it sounded like an episode of Jersey Shore was being filmed right. outside. my window. The music was so loud I could feel the bass vibrating my bed, and had to listen to lots of ""whoooooo!"" and also some bro talk. I was so glad when that damn thing ended. This hotel markets itself as a social place, though, so you already know what you're getting yourself into. Also, on Saturday night around 9pm, two young men in staff shirts came by and knocked on my door to do some housekeeping. What? Why are you coming to my door on a Saturday night to fix up my room? I called the front desk to make sure that was normal (and yknow, they weren't some crazy dudes from next door) and the front desk assured me they were just being thorough. 

The pool is pretty cool, though, and impressive. Think Vegas style. I don't know how appealing the furniture is because it's a little dirty and stained up, but I could see myself laying in the sun for a few hours at some point this week. The workout room is also a good size with tons of equipment!

I made it back here less than two weeks after the Yelp Elite Event for a dinner with co-workers. If I come back here a million times, the view here will always leave me awestruck. There can't be a better place in The Valley to bring someone special to take their breath away.
Since there were five of us and we love to share, we were able to sample a little of everything. We started with the scallops and duck ravioli. At the Yelp Elite Event I pretty much had a permanent spot at the scallop station so we all know how I feel about the scallops. The duck ravioli was delicious too. LOVED the appetizers.

I have to say that those of us who ordered the filet mignon for our main suffered severe buyer's remorse after my co-worker shared her venison with us. The venison was tender and smoky flavored and not at all gamy tasting. Served with sweet potatoes, I am KICKING myself for not ordering the venison. I do have issues with eating animals whom I classify as lovable and beautiful so venison, along with lamb and rabbit are usually off-limits. Had I known what the venison was going to taste like, I think I would have made an exception (FORGIVE ME, BAMBI!!)

My filet mignon with horseradish crust, was not bad but especially compared to the venison seemed a bit dull. That didn't stop me from eating all of it.  I have to give them props for the bread they served because it came with a choice of mushroom truffle herb butter, arugula pesto (which was AWESOME) and the THIRD spread, which for the life of me I CAN'T remember was awesome too.....it really was a toss up between the pesto and forgotten spread.

We also enjoyed some delicious cocktails and a great bottle of malbec, and later some desert. I can only vouch for my Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brulee which was a great way to finish our meal.

The service was impeccable, although my co-worker and I were both given the lobster bisque when we ordered salad. This is hardly a tragedy though because I got to enjoy the lobster bisque too.

Different Pointe of View is definitely a place you'd come only on a special occasion but it is, for this Yelper, one of the best fine dining options in The Valley. Just review the menu carefully and listen to your server....you don't want to be out-ordered!",review,5,wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow

We arrived during happy hour which saved me a bit on the beer I had but hamburgers were on our minds so that is what we ordered.  We both ordered the cheeseburger with blue cheese.

I ordered the coleslaw and she ordered fries and we split the sides both of which we enjoyed.

When the employee went to the clean the door and windows, he sprayed the Windex like crazy and the fan totally blew it all over my table. Before I could even react to the situation, the manger was correcting the employee for the bad cleaning technique decision and immediately offered to make me a new sandwich even though I only had about a 1/4 left. In less than a minute I had my new sub, which I will actually have for breakfast in the morning. 

I understand that everyone makes mistakes and that often at fast food joints it is an employee's first job, so I usually expect the management to make right any of the blunders, without the customer having to raise a fuss.

This recent visit they were offering a five course fixed menu with wine pairings for $65/person.  I love these type events because the chef can experiment with new recipes and as a guest I get to try many new flavors and wines.

This meal progressed from scallops to roasted guinea hen to halibut to Berkshire pork to chocolate cake.  My favorite was the pork and least favorite course was the chocolate cake with the lime sorbet.

I stopped by Whole Foods and took a look in their meat showcase.  They showed grass fed rib eye steaks for over $20 per pound.  

I don't mind spending money on good steaks.  What I didn't understand what the 'grass fed' surcharge.  I know cows eat grass.  But why charge extra because the cow eats grass exclusively?  The butcher at Whole Foods simply said grass fed beef was better.  

Now why am I talking about Whole Foods, in a Von Hanson's review?  Glad you thought that.  I figured I needed a alternative opinion.  I searched for 'butcher meat' on Yelp and found several shops.  Von Hanson's was close to my house so off I went.

Entering the store there is a selection of beer and wine to the right and a cold showcase of meats along the back wall.  The front and left walls contained freezers containing a variety of delectable deserts, a dizzying array of cooked sausages, and 'grill packs'.  In the center of the store was another freezer containing treats for pets.  I bought my dog a bone she will be chewing on for days.  

 I headed for the meat case and asked the nice man behind the counter if his beef was corn or grass fed.  His answer was immediate.  ' Corn fed, corn makes tasty and tender beef. '.  He spoke further of how grass fed beef may be a little leaner, but it is not as tasty.  I'm all for a healthy diet.  No need to get carried away.  

There were two knowledgeable polite and informative butchers behind the counter.  They patiently explained the different cuts of meat and grilling methods to a woman who was planning a family dinner.  I agreed with his recommendation of thick cut rib eye steaks, simply seasoned, and grilled.  

I am sure I will stop by this place again.  I love grilling and smoking.  Whole Foods is good for fruits and vegetables.  This is the place for meat.",review,3,709mdW0FIHy4BY-ymBPKNQ

I really miss the intimate feeling of the original building. Although I'm happy they had to expand for a growing clientele a part of me wishes they kept the coffee shop a coffee shop and had the food/bar in the new building. 

I've also been here twice since the new building, both on a Sunday afternoon and it was so packed! The first Sunday i was able to find a spot to do work, but today i was unable to and just had to turn out the door after doing a lap around and seeing no seats at a table open. I never had that happen in the previous building... Perhaps when the weather is cooler this will improve.",review,0,4mr5Ys9VKe87c_kgpRbQ0Q

I was skeptical since so many people are uneducated on the cuisine, the restaurant's website did not list many dishes that I enjoy, and there was much english spoken on the menu. Even their Bun Bo Hue required a special order of pig blood, and there was no mention of pate or ham hock. I chalked it up to an American place to get Pho, which is to Vietnamese as Spaghetti is to Italian. I mean, most American's eat it because it is ""safe"" and their brains are comfortable with it. 

Whatever, I tried it anyway. This place blew my mind! I ended up ordering a ""safe"" dish because that is all they had on the menu and it really wowed me. Bun Bi Cha Gio, which is something that I actually eat quite frequently was so high in quality and so different from what I am used to. The pork tasted so well seasoned and was very interesting, bean sprouts were amazingly fresh and plentiful, cucumbers and lettuce were crisp and delightful. Overall, the bowl was as if someone had hand picked the veggies and taken them directly from the garden to the bowl. The nuoc mam was a little disappointing after seeing the amazing quality of everything else, it was still very nice but not as flavorful as I prefer. When I make my own I use a Thai Chili in each batch, so I'm just used to a little spicier. 

Something here that is not so typical of a Vietnamese restaurant is the relative fanciness of it. They have done a nice job of making this a warm and inviting enviroment without it resulting in crazy high prices, such as you'll find at Cyclo. I was thrilled with the service, as it was the first time in ANY Vietnamese restaurant that I received a refill on my water without asking for it, and I've eaten Vietnamese for a LONG time. 

Overall, I can't give Pho Ao Sen five stars because the menu does not have all the great dishes that is indicative of the cuisine and favors to the safe bets for Americans. I understand their target audience and who lives in the neighborhood, but I wish they would not sell themselves short and stay true to their roots.

This night I had the asparagus wrapped in prosciutto....while good, the asparagus were a bit too large and therefore not very tasty....it was served with a little olive oil and balsamic, so not too interesting.

I chose a Diavalo pizza with fresh garlic added.  The crust was good, the sauce was minimal(coulda used a little more), a little too light on the cheese, and it had pepperoni and fresh jalapenos....good taste but just seemed to be missing something?!  

The service was cordial, but not overly friendly and it seemed like the folks were unhappy that we came in late(8pm).

The only place to linger if you aren't smoking is the humidor anyway right?  

It was so large I completely forget I showed up near close.  They were never pushy and came to ask if we needed anything a few times.  I didn't realize until we left.  I am never that guy, and felt bad for it.  We grabbed a few cigars and hit the road.

The prices are quite high.  I bought some Sancho Panza's at 40% off and they were still more expensive than a larger cigar (same line) in the humidor at Total Wine.  With it being further from my house than 5-10 other cigar shops and that I typically avoid the 'Tuke because of the resident's being in denial about actually living in Phoenix...  I will stick closer to home.  The other reason is I avoid places with employees that pack heat.  Too much overcompensation screws up my chi.

I'm going to give four stars for gemütlichkeit (coziness), since I had a great time hanging out in the bar listening to accordion music coming from a table full of regulars. The bartender was also personable and conversational, so I stuck around after my first beer in order to quaff a second and order some grub off of the bar menu.

I was intrigued by the bratwurst sliders. I'm pretty tuned in to what decent bratwurst should taste like, since I lived in Germany for nearly three years. I'm partial to the Thüringer style, which is what I came across growing up in West Berlin, but everyone in the Phoenix area appears to favor the Nürnburger variety. The Nürnburger style is perfectly acceptable to me however, as I had eaten a delicious one on the street at the Mesa Christkindlmarkt (Christmas market) just a few days earlier.

Let me offer my comments about where Black Forest Mill got it wrong. The bratwurst sliders were served with sauerkraut which was just too darn sour. I glanced at some fellow bar diners who left their sauerkraut nearly untouched. They really need to cut back on the brininess (rinse it better before preparing or add some apples to balance it out). I don't think this is an ""American palette"" issue... it really is nearly inedible. Now the bratwurst ""slider"" is a novel idea I applaud. But they were served on sweet dinner rolls which were soft (almost like Hawaiian bread). Not only did they get soggy sitting in some sauerkraut juice drifting over from the other side of the plate, but it was the wrong flavor and texture counterpoint to the sausage. A sturdier more rustic European-type brötchen is what I was hoping for. And the bratwurst themselves were unremarkable. Tasted boiled... should've been grilled. The mustard that came with them was the standard American substitute for German mustard, Gulden's spicy brown mustard, which isn't bad. However, I had just shopped next door at the German Sausage Company (presumably the same owners?) and noticed they had authentic sharp German Löwensenf. I think it would've been a real treat if this restaurant could've offered some of that on the side instead.

So, call me picky if you must. But I think I know German food and, although I loved the atmosphere and the beer, I think the Black Forest Mill could step it up a bit on the food preparation. I will post an update if I return and try something here that hits the mark. The waiter kept talking up the schnitzel sampler, and the gulasch and spätzle sound awfully tempting.

Screw wal-mart. I never learn anything at wal-mart, except that the third world's largest export is Spider-Man pajamas and that little Johnny wandered away from mommy and daddy and is waiting for them at Customer Service where he's already tore into a Hershey's Bar that they will be expected to pay for.

I love how they give me a ridiculous amount of options on a choice that I shouldn't be tasked to make. Why make ramen when I can have my pick of hundreds of different kinds of noodles, none of which have I any experience making!? 

Fuck it. I'm taking the Mi Chay, the imitation shrimp noodle and the cantonese egg noodle. 

And at about 99 cents (give or take) a bag of exotic carbohydrate madness, I can finally live out my forty-five-minute-old dream of eating every style of Asian noodle!

Which, once you factor in that about 80 percent of my diet is piles and piles of noodles, means I will probably get to accomplish this before the end of the month.

Okay, not a whole aisle.

It's a spoon/fork/chopstick aisle.

But half of it is chopsticks. 

It's right next to the aisle with all the plates and bowls that you see at all the other Chinese and Japanese restaurants you've ever been to.

Huh. I've slurped miso out of a bowl that looked just like this one.

I could buy this bowl. And get the stuff to make miso and then I could have my own restaurant-style miso in my RESTAURANT STYLE BOWL at home!!!!111

But I won't. Because there is no atmosphere at my house and I hate eating alone. 

That's why I bento.

Because I can determine it's fresh. Because it's still looking at me.

Who do you think you are, challenging me to a staring contest right before they killed you and put you out on the shelf?

The only problem with Lee to the second power is that it's right across the street from Pholicious.

Which means any time I would drive over there to try their restaurant, I would get sidetracked and just drive over to Pholicious.

Goddamit. This is the problem with de facto segregation.

A whimsical foodie could easily go broke here. I watch their ads and generally only buy things on sale or occasional indulgences (read: weekly sugar cookie trip). Surprisingly here, some things are no more expensive than other grocery stores (gallons of water, certain condiments, Peanut M&Ms, off the top of my head), but a lot of specialty items and most of the produce are nooooot cheap. Just the act of shopping here makes me giddy- there's nice lighting and soooo much beautiful food all around. 

My absolute favorite thing here is the bakery- it's top notch. Depending on how early in the day you go, there may or may not be a lot of things to choose from. I love the sugar cookie and also the red velvet cupcake. You can't go wrong with the cheesecakes, and the tartufo we found during the holidays was the richest food i've ever eaten (chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse layered with chocolate cake, covered in chocolate). Their coffee drinks are also pretty good although I have to ask for a bit less sugar. 

The prepared food bars are also delicious- they serve a dinner every night that promises a good meal but at a cost of $12-16 a plate. The salad bar is good for lunch. I haven't yet tried the sandwich/pizza bar, but it smells good when i'm there. The sushi bar also has happy hour specials in the afternoons. 

Going on around the store, there is an extensive meat and seafood counter. The butchers are knowledgeable about what they sell and are happy to cut/wrap things differently for you. Recently there was a sale on Kobe beef and I came in at least 3 times that week! Everything always looks and smells very fresh.

Ok, I feel like i've covered the highlights. Beyond this, if you're after something very specific/hard to find, this store will be the one to have it if anyone does. It's fun to come buy a new gourmet salsa/sauce/coffee, snacks, or just look around. Many of the things are expensive, so make sure it's something really special!",review,0,-6f74MeztMVqdKBUQSM2gA

I didn't stay at the hotel but partook in SpaWeek and had a 50-minute massage at the Spa.  

This spa is very small and a strange setup.   It almost seems as the ""spa"" was an afterthought for the hotel and is quickly outgrowing the space they have allotted for it. 

You check in and then go to your womens/mens locker room to change into your robe and then come back out to the check-in area in your robe (which is also where people are getting manicures/pedicures) - so far- not relaxing..  They then usher you out the door and across the hall (which is a hallway filled with hotel rooms).  Across the hall is your ""relaxation room""  aka a hotel room with the bed removed and some chairs, magazines and some fancy water with pineapple, oranges and cucumber floating in it. 

When its your turn , they come into the room grab you and bring you back across the hall to your treatment room which is back where the locker rooms are.  The actual treatment room they put me in had a wall divider used so I could sometimes hear the people in the next room.  

Overall, the masseuse was really good, but the atmosphere its self wasn't that calm and relaxing.

As for the class, here's the deal ... I know nothing about Yoga, and this was my first Yoga class. It kicked my slacker ass, but I felt all the better for it. The cute as hell instructor could not have been a nicer person (I'm seeing a pattern here). She instructed the class in a relaxing yet deliberate and concise manner.

Just a top notch business all around. Did I mention that the owners were out of the world nice, cool and down to earth people? Well it can't be said enough ...

Forgive my confusion, but I as I sat in this architectural joy with exposed brick, glass, inside out side bar, and the much talked about pulley suspended loft, I could not help to think i must not be in Phoenix.   Turns out I was and make no mistake this place is must more than just a pretty face.

Although not a very large menu - several items called to me from the page - so we let the server do the driving for us.  The goat cheese app was a perfect beginning, and as we were about 3 crostinis short on the cheese to bread balance, our server was quick to bring a few more, so that precious cheese would not go to waste.   My wife had the Seafood soup which was absolutley a joy.  Even good restaurants these days fall short of truly inspired flavor and this dish loaded with fresh seafood in a delicate yet savory broth was just amazing.  It had a personality all its own familiar yet a little exciting at the same time.  For me it was the Pork chop with the finest polenta I have every had.  If there is a filet mignon of pork chops this was it.  Since my wife is having a baby any minute now I had a glass of Tempronillo which I thought was nice option on a wine by the glass list.  We finished off with a simple but perfectly done apple-crisp ala mode.  After our meal we sat back with the quite satisfaction and grin of the chesire cat.   Nothing needed to be said we were in culinary paradise.  

If that is not enough - the real magic of this place is the synergy of it all.  The food is amazing, the room has snap, but it all comes together with a diverse crowd unassuming yet hip (I hate that word).  A lovely group of four older people, next to my wife and I, sharing the energy with a young couple certainly on their first date and 4 ladies out for the evening.  Yes we all know Phoenix is growing and getting better every day, but this place is forcing its hand.  The city was alive and vibrant and best of all real , in this little masterpiece.

Our first impression was good... Adorable ambiance, delicious looking case of gelato, large inviting patio.  We were greeted by a sloppy surly man, who we later found out is the owner Andy. 
We were seated on the patio along with the only other customer.  We started off by ordering a bottle of sparking water. ""You guys don't want any wine?!"" said Andy abruptly. Uh no thanks.  Next we ordered dinner.  My sister is vegetarian, so we were ordering meatless options this evening.  We ordered a selection of bland, boring, typical food. For some reason Andy seemed confused that we wanted to share a few items.  The food came... Andy dropped it and ran off.  We were sharing so we wanted plates. We waited for a long time. No Andy.  I went into the restaurant to ask for plates and some salt&pepper. Andy seemed confused. ""why do you need plates? I don't get it. You eatin it like Chinese food or something?!?"" He brought the plates and the salt & pepper and said ""You know you really shouldn't put anything on it until you taste it."" Thanks for the words of wisdom.  
We ate our depressing display of  cuisine in hopes that dessert would help this disaster. We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more( Andy was busy sitting at the other customer's table talking all night).  By the time he finally got around to clear our plates we were so ready to get the heck outta there we decided to skip dessert. 

NEXT CAME THE ICING ON THE POORLY MADE CAKE:
I decided to tell Andy how I felt about the poor service.  As a person in the customer service industry, I know I would appreciate the polite constructive criticism.

We had poleta fries( my aunt/uncle love these so much, we had 3 orders).  They are tasty and probably the best value.

She loved the burger and it was large( the biggest entree of all the entrees we ordered)  However, 16.00 is expensive.  It came with bacon, cheese, carmalized onions and sweet potato chips( not fries).  My uncle had duck.  I took one bite and spit it out,  Way too gamey.  That was a stingy portion too for 23.00. Dessert was 9.00 and was comped because it was my birthday.  9.00 for bread puding( stale bread that is pure profit) is pricey.  My uncle had another appetizer, a calamari salad.  This had to be the stingiest portion too at 14.00 and he ordered a side of pickled veggies for 5.00( another small portion).

The dining area is somewhat darkly lit.

To begin, I like any of the shrimp -- whether it be the Barbecued Shrimp or Shrimp Cocktail. For the entrée, I recommend a Filet or a T-Bone; the latter, if you have a big appetite.

Appetizer prices range from about $13 to $16. Steaks range from about $35 to $45. However, there is a Porterhouse that is to feed two people. The Porterhouse for two is upwards of about $80.

My main problem with Ruth's Chris Steak House is that they seem to butter the steak excessively. Moreover, the prices are a bit inflated for what you get -- which is expected.

It's difficult to get anything done or any help here, and if they agree to help you with anything, the hourly clock is always ticking ($$$).  The attitude is the final straw; they act like you're disturbing their work.

Overall the facility is middle of the road.  The docks themselves consist of concrete pavers over floating structure, and are *impossible* to walk on barefoot.

I was introduced to Fuego Bistro by my roommate who had purchased a Groupon without knowing anything about the restaurant.

It has a charming vibe, it's off the beaten path in a quirky courtyard bordered by a salon and dance studio. But the food was unremarkable... not by any means inedible, but rather forgettable. I felt the restaurant concept was a little confused given the choice of sides which don't necessarily pair well with every entree. I had the seared ahi tuna which was topped with a balsamic reduction and a mango/red pepper/avocado salsa. It was cooked properly but underseasoned except for the balsamic reduction which was nothing but sweet. Perhaps the blandness of this dish could be remedied with chili and lime and salt, but regardless, it did not deliver on taste. I chose to have the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans as side dishes. The green beans were the best of the two, simple and tender, but the potatoes were lacking in flavor. Chipotle was only hinted at and the cheese was entirely understated. I know there has to be a way to elevate this food, but Fuego has fallen short. 

My roommate was in agreement that the meal was not a hit. Even the Key Lime Pie for dessert did not make the grade. I see potential in this restaurant, since the staff is friendly and helpful.

My hair was getting way too long and ragged and I wanted to do something different, but not drastic. 

One day, I got it. Bangs! Not the kind I had as a kid, but the wispy messy side-part kind. I usually only got a straight trim, so ability was never an issue in the past- anyone with a pair of scissors could cut my hair for all I cared. But something like this- I know you can screw that up! 

I decided I deserved a treat and would go somewhere nice- I was starting to look into other places but while browsing the weekly ads, I saw Ulta had a deal for $20 for a first-time haircut. This was too good of a deal and a good chance to try somewhere new, so I called and booked right away. 

Later that week, I went in and was met by my hairstylist, Martha. She introduced herself and sat me down and we went over my hair. I had brought in a picture of what I was after and she discussed layer lengths with me, then cut a small section of my hair. 

Next, I got a nice but brief shampoo, and then back to the chair. Martha was very meticulous with getting my hair even and my layers perfect- I have thick wavy hair so they have to be chunky so they don't get all poofy and feathered. We got to the bangs, and she knew exactly how to cut them perfectly- I'm in love! She finished drying my hair and did some basic styling, and I was good to go. 

A great first experience. I feel like I now have a ""hair place"" to go to, and look forward to coming back soon! The prices are on the low end of salons in the area, and for the quality seems to be well worth it.",review,1,-6f74MeztMVqdKBUQSM2gA

Hell, you could easily pass right by it and not even notice its there. But that all adds to the charm of The Breadfruit and makes it seem like its a secret place that only you and whoever you are dining with knows about. Its also a romantic place for a date. The paintings on the wall are for sale. It can get a bit loud when it gets filled only because the place is small. But that's a minor gripe. When my girlfriend and I go she gets the brown stew chicken. I get either the curry chicken and dumplings or the jerk chicken, and I don't even like spicy food that much. But the jerk chicken is so good I love it. quote me on what im about to say. THE BREADFRUIT HAS SOME OF THE BEST AND STRONGEST DRINKS! I love their drinks there because they are never watered down. The first sip of your drink may seem pretty overwhelming. But don't worry, its just the alcohol telling your tastebuds to wake the hell up! The drinks are smooth and very tasty and you just taste a hint of alcohol in the drink even though they put alot in them. Which ive always thought was good when the alcohol doesn't overpower the taste of the drink. The Dark & Stormy regular or the Dark & Stormy 151 are my drink of choice, highly recommend either one of those. One more thing. Whatever you order make sure you get a side of festival bread. I don't care if your meal already comes with it, order a side anyway. Its very delicious bread. A dinner for a couple averages between $40-$60 if u just get dinner and a couple drinks.

The hotel restaurant provides huge portions and great service. 

The pool is the center piece of this place literally and figuratively. The pool  itself is nothing spectacular. They try to make a pseudo vegas environment. DJ comes in the afternoon and lots of alcohol is served. The people (characters?) are what makes this place unique. I felt like I was in the middle of an open casting call for the next cast of the Jersey Shore. 

Also, we rented a cabana for the sole purpose of having shade. The roof was hooked up so their were gaps and they wouldn't let us close the curtain for shade. I wouldn't recommend shelling out $500 for one of these. 

They also get a bit nazi with their bracelets and pool entrance on the weekends. The side entrances are tied shut (I'm thinking this is a hazard). There are always at least three people at the front entrance. You must wear a bracelet just to walk around the pool and a second one for the cabana. Why two? If I have a cabana bracelet doesn't that mean I'm allowed into the pool area?

Apparently, the hotel does not like outside cabs. They have a deal going with a car service. So you are forced to spend about 25% more than you would with a cab. I'm guessing that 25% is going back to the hotel.",review,1,1t9DDgGknL4ViFUS2aCs7w

The patio had so much potential, however having no lighting I was not the only one struggling to see the menu.

Drinks: The extremely watered down sangria that tasted like white grape juice with A SINGLE canned peach slice stuck to the bottom. Just nasty. Even the water smelled like mildew and I didn't dare touch the dried out lemons.

Appetizer: My fiance ordered the Fiaggi Misti (meat and cheese assortment, supposedly) It consisted of Oscar Meyer look a like garlic bologna, even worse ""sopressatta"" that looked like a hunk of fat, and two choices of tiny pieces of dried out cheeses. Oh yes, let us not forget the store bought bread sticks brought out in their packaging still, on top of the assortment still in the damn wrappers, stuck between 3 kalamata olives. What the hell do I do with all the wrappers now? Beyond disgusting. Worst part is that they charge $15 for the damn thing!! 

Dinner: Now I enjoy my pizza well done. I just do. Don't ask, just make it happen, ok??! The Toscana pizza that we ordered, was neither well done, and had Wal-Mart quality ingredients. Terrible mozzarella, soggy whole mushrooms, and bland sausage with zero fennel, whatsoever. The sauce was more of a bland paste than a sauce.

I should have been sipping a cocktail at a fabulous Sunday brunch.  Perhaps I should have been in a little mountain cabin somewhere escaping the heat.  But no, here I am at Walmart, wearing a free t-shirt lamenting about how fat I've become, while looking for TV dinner trays.  Did you get that?  TV DINNER TRAYS.  Because my husband does not want to sit at the table situated 3 feet from the sofa, and he's tired of my eagle eye waiting for him to spill something.

Deciding that I deserve better, we left Walmart and headed for Target.  This Target is generally clean and not too busy.  Pretty much my only requirements for a Target.  We found the trays, perhaps I should call them modular furniture, and wouldn't you know it..all of them were scuffed.  And my husband points out the ones at Walmart match our living room better.  Uh, we are NOT going to be leaving them out I remind him (now anticipating the arguments to come).  So I took them to customer service to see if they had any unscuffed ones in the back, they didn't.  Remembering that Donald S' beautiful Carin got a discount, I asked for one, too, and was quickly offered 10%.  I took it remembering full well that the beautiful Carin was given 20%..nothing like a little salt on the wound.

Moral of the story.  This target is clean with pleasant, accommodating employees for the most part, and easy to maneuver since it is not the circus of a Walmart.  And they offer discounts...based on appearances.",review,8,wHg1YkCzdZq9WBJOTRgxHQ

It's very similar to the main restaurant, filled with old-world French charm and haute-cuisine, but less expensive and less formal.  The space is somewhat cramped and gets quite loud, and last Saturday night the AC was barely working.  However despite these nuances, it was still an enjoyable and delicious meal.  The crowd was incredibly senior-- I felt like quite the spring chicken being the youngest at 31 years of age (which I must admit I didn't mind seeing as last time I went out in Scottsdale it was filled with 21-year olds all of whom seemed to already be botox-laden).
The food:
Curly Endive Salad with Mustard Dressing, Bacon, and Poached Egg- the deep, tangy, creamy Dijon dressing was perfect over the crunchy endive.  Add to that fatty, crispy bacon and a perfectly poached egg and you've got a near-perfect salad.
The homemade lobster bisque (SOD) was exquisite.  Silky and creamy, loads of lobster flavor and just hints of butter in the background.
Salmon Quesadilla- it actually wasn't much of an actual quesadilla but more like a flatbread, and it was my absolute favorite.  It's the classic pairing- dill, horseradish cream, etc, and very well-executed.
Four Cheese Ravioli- they made this usual ho-hum dish sparkle with a light tomato basil sauce and sharp, delicious cheeses.
Other guests in our party had the lamb shank and the filet mignon special, each of which were devoured with praise.
The desserts also shone brightly- a fig tart with honey ice cream, profiteroles with rich dark chocolate sauce, luscious flourless chocolate cake- all were most-delectable.

I wanted to see how good/bad my usual place (Cho Dang) was.  I wasn't surprised to find out that Cho Dang is in a league of its own when it comes to Korean BBQ in CHandler.  Takamatsu was as underwhelming as it gets.

The decor is like a cafeteria.  Patrons are very loud.  It seems that everyone goes there for the all you can eat sushi.  The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.

We ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.  

Out came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.  

Overall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.  

This place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.  I didn't see a single Korean there eating which is a bad sign.  I saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters, a few SE-Asians and several old people. 

I gave it a shot once and won't be back.  Worst Korean food I've ever eaten without question.  Yelp reviewers are really starting to get a bad rap with me.  If this is the best Korean BBQ you have had, what places could possibly be worse?",review,3,OMC3DRyGrDbq-oMtdRAH8Q

I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe.

My roommate took me here on saturday and i was pretty excited when I arrived.  They had his and hers fire hydrants out front, which is pretty cool.  I peed on one and we made our way inside.  First we checked out the food section. They carry my favorite brand, Taste of the Wild.  (Previously I had only found this at Kodi's on 16th St. and Bethany.)   Then I perused the accessories.  Nice necklaces and pretty awesome toys.  I found a super cool Stegasauraus and carried it around for a while. 

Then my rooomate says, ""hey, let's go check out the back.""  The back?  There's more to this awesome place?  Heck yes, let's go!   And then everything changed....  The door swung open to the back of the store.  I heard other guys in there crying.  What the hell was going on?  

My roommate picked me up and put me into this steel box.  Some sort of medieval torture device.  (Dude, i thought we were cool, wtf?!)   Then he puts on an apron and gets to work.  Splash, bam, boom.... water torture!  Its a nightmare. Soap everywhere, i tried to escape but i was tied down.  After what felt like 14 years he turned off the water started to towel dry me off.  Then he gave me some cologne.  (That doesnt make this okay bro.)

Finally i made my exit and back to the ""front"" of the store.  I rushed around and tried to warn all the other dudes and bitches in there, but none of them listened.  I think a few actually enjoyed that room.  Masochists.  

So I made my roommate buy me some gourmet snacks.  Peanut Butter stars were good, but the little Cinnamon Rolls were my favorite.  I also got 2 frozen bison bones with marrow... which i intend on eating on my roommates bed and pillow as revenge.  Oh, and i got my Stegasaurus.

I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

My sliders also had a spec of artichoke and a chunk of very ripe tomato . I received onion fries that tasted sort of like BBQ seasoning mixed with seafood seasoning .

We also had the Chipotle Meatball sliders with Bonfire chips . My companion thought the meatballs were dry . These sandwiches didn't have enough sauce to get any taste of it and the shaved Parmesan was cooked into a sauce that were topped on the meatballs (we were expecting shaved parmesan since that is on the menu) .

-Firecracker Pork = BEST PORK EVER. I've never had such a yummy pork dish from a take out chinese food place. The sauce they put on it is AMAZING. I want it on everything!

-Potstickers = these were really fat/full of pork and veggies. Pan fried on one side. I'm more of a thinner, pan fry both side kinda girl, but they were alright.

-Crab puffs = I hate cream cheese, so I hated these, but my whole family LOVED them. I gave it a shot and it was sweet too, which I thought was weird. Not down.

-Mongolian Beef and snow peas = Finally a place with not bouncy/fatty beef! I never found a weird piece or was upset about the texture of the beef. It was good stuff.

-Pork fried rice = nothing special, but it wasn't bad.

-Sweet n Sour shrimp (I think it was that..) = normal, wasn't amazed, but really good non the less.

A group of friends and I decided on this place after another friend gave it a thumbs up. Ok, I thought. I love buffets.

First thing I noticed, more than five people standing in the front smoking. Like you have to shuffle passed them to get it. What if I had my baby with me? Or my family? Second, some woman was asking everyone to wash their car windows in exchange for diapers. SMH!!

So we go inside to a very crowded small one man register. I paid for two friends and myself. Plus three drinks??? $42.00 So letter me get this straight. This is a buffet but without self serving access to a beverage bar?? And I had to pay for it? Why am i here and not at old country buffet? 

So we are seated. Not a bad atmosphere except for the large crowd. I went and collected my food. I got fried chicken and a side salad and bread roll to go with my iced tea. All crap, even the tea.

Worst chicken I've ever had. And its hard for me to not finish fried chicken down to the bone. Bit this fiscrace of a piece of crap just simply wasnt worthy for my stomache. Bland. Not that crispy. A little dry. Smelled funny. Bread was stale. Salad wasnt that fresh although it wasnt too bad. And tea was brisk which isn't tea. 

In order to get refills I had to wait for waitress to come and do it for me cause im a baby who cant get his own drink? I didnt even try the dessert. 

Overall not impressed. But I guess the dishes were clean and they had catfish off the grill. I didn't try it but it did smell good. If I were in a buffet mood, old country and home town are better selections. Also they are cheaper.",review,4,3__t5LGrD4ER9qvFxmlHzA

They were open...so that was a good start.  I'm a sucker for good German food (but quick to be annoyed by German slop claiming to be good food).  

The Goodness:  They were open on Memorial Day, that's a good start.  $5.50 0.5liter beers is another good starting point (I got a tasty hefeweizen myself).  We both had one of their off menu specials, the Lamb Loin.  It came out green beans that were mixed up and cooked with bacon and fried up and potatoes that appear to have been fried up in Parmesan cheese or something.  They were all sitting in this tasty dark liquidy gravy next to this perfectly cooked and seasoned lamb loin. The lamb loin did require a knife to cut it up...but it was still very tender.  Tender and tasty.  I can't quite describe what it tasted like.  It is kind of like a good roast, but better.  

The Meh/Bad:  While the barkeep/waitress was nice enough....we were pretty much the only people sitting at the bar.  Having to wait about 10 minutes before seeing anyone was kind of blah.  Add to that when my friend asks the lady if they have any ""lunch specials"" she rattles off their list of ""specialties"" (off-menu ""specialties"").  We were unaware that we had this much of a misunderstanding...until the bill came...then we were keenly aware.  Not sure anything ""on-menu"" was that expensive.  It cost each of us $30 for the meal and a beer ($5.50 for a half liter of good German beer is pretty good though).

Anyway, two tables were sat after we got our food and three or more of the original parties were still there when we left.  Would I wait that long to sit near a belt?  No way.

The good part about Teharu is that it is decent quality sushi (nothing special) for SUPER CHEAP.  Four adults and 1 child got away with a $38 bill, including one large beer ($4) two soft drinks and a juice.  Also, that included shrimp tempura and a bowl of rice for the little one.  

The bad part is that the shrimp tempura was not completely cooked (the batter was still somewhat undercooked on a couple pieces).  

Also, the music was quite loud.  It wasn't really my style.  As an aside... They were playing a Pandora station with commercials and all... I don't think Pandora would be too happy about that, either!  I think you have to have a commercial license for that!

It appears to be a clean place, so eat here with confidence.

Overall, I would eat here again if it pleased my mother.  Still, I wouldn't head to this place on my own.  I favor Mido Sushi (just a few blocks away) for many reasons.",review,3,64YY0h0ZAR2nbzxbx0IwJg

I had a college professor years ago that used to swear by it.  It always interested me, so when I received a coupon in the local mailer, a friend and I decided to give it a go.  I'm a naturally athletic person, but yoga had never been anything I had dabbled in.  The coupon was $10 for 10 days of unlimited yoga.  

The deal with Bikram yoga is the routine is the same every time.  There are 26 postures that are repeated in the same order each session and lasts 90 minutes.  The room is about 105 degrees and 40% humidity.  You sweat like a pig, but don't wipe it off b/c it will help cool you down - that's my little knowledge gift to you.

Shelby and John Rayner are the owners and teach many of the classes.  They used to teach them all, but I think they have hired some additional instructors.  The decor and ambiance is very calming and it's a very positive place.  The instructors try to learn your name as quickly as possible and make you feel welcome.  I'm not going to lie, Bikram yoga is tough as nails, but I found it very satisfying.  I had to take it down one star on the vote just because it is so damn expensive.  I haven't been since I completed my 10 day trial, but hopefully I'll be able to pick it up when I have some more walkin' around money.

If you're looking for something new, check out Bikram Yoga Avondale and let the Rayners take care of you.  Also browse their website b/c it's really informational.  They've gotten so busy in the last few months they have added additional class times and online sign-ups (there were no sign-ups when I went).  Also, they have a better maiden voyage deal for the newbies - $40 for one month unlimited.  It was hard to orchestrate it all within 10 days - one month is much more generous so take advantage and give it a whirl!

P.S.  The small, tight fitting clothing isn't just so people can flaunt what they've got.  It really helps you do the postures more effectively.  Plus, if you wear sweats or any sort of bulky clothing, you'll feel like you want to die.  So, the moral of the story is to man up and go with the flow.  The patrons are great and no one cares what other folks are wearing.  Actually, you might stick out if you're sportin' the sweatsuit so get skimpy to blend in.",review,3,#NAME?

I finally checked these guys out and my wife and I both have work done by Tony now. Now I have the tattoos that people literally stop me in the grocery store, bank, gym... everywhere, just to see them. EVERYONE in this shop is AMAZING!!! My wife's boss has an amazing full back piece done by Uncle Josh and it's off the chain too! The cleanliness of the shop and the attitude of the people here is great. Most tattoo shops feel more like a pawn shop. The people artist are normally jerks and not inviting at all. At Lady Luck this in so not the case. Everybody just hangs out and watches killer classic movies all day. Last time I was in we watched Big Trouble in Little China. Classic!  Its a great place with phenomenal artists! You won't go wrong!  I have a few pics of some of the work we started on my profile. Feel free to check it out.

In addition, there is 1 bad review on here from a guy named Victor. I actually referred him. After seeing all the incedible work Tony has done for me, he decided get a  cover up from Tony. Tony's cover up was awesome! Victor even called me right afterwards and told me, and I quote ""That guy is a wizzard"" because he was so amazed and happy with the tattoo. Thus the ""returning customer"" part of Victor's review. Victor got piseed off and walked out on his 2nd appt because Tony was running a few minutes behind and said it would be 20 minutes or so. Big deal. Welcome to a tattoo shop. A tattoo is art and art takes time. If Tony is running late, which is known to do, I don't care. I know he is going to give me the same attention and dedication he gave the client before me. I find peace in knowing he will never rush my piece just to get to the next guy in line or keep an appointment time. Judge the shop by their ability and art, not by an appt time. If you want minute by minute appointment times don't get your hopes up in a tattoo shop or waiting for the cable guy. Tony is booked out months in advance for a reason.

I do! Just a question to ponder while you what in a long line for a juicy burger at this no-frills eatery.  We showed up on a beautiful Friday, so of course there was a mad rush. Unfortunately, there was no free parking available, so I paid for parking across the street at the ASU lot.

After walking up to order a bacon burger and fries, we got lunch served on a paper plate, like you would at a family BBQ or picnic grill. Seriously, it's no frills. Then, you head over to the condiment bar to get your own lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, onion, etc. Just like if you were at a family BBQ. Noticing a trend?  Now, find a place to sit, but warning, it might be sticky!

On to the food: the burger was juicy, and had good flavor, but the bun was TERRIBLE. Grocery-store-white-bread-soggy-in-10-seconds, wait, the kind that you get at a family BBQ, bun.  Toppings were acceptable, not exceptional.  Fries were decent.  You gotta eat pretty fast before the sandwich falls apart.

Cons: bad bun.

I loved the giant sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant.  We sat at the sushi bar and it was really fun to watch them prepare food all night.

We started off with a couple of drinks, I got the pink mojito which I really enjoyed, it wasn't sweet which was perfect for me, my husband got a sochu which he ended up not liking very much.  We ordered the butterfish tataki, kobe beef and kimchi dumplings, tempura shrimp, himachi serrano chili roll, and spicy tuna roll.  They brought the butterfish out first; it was good but not as good as some of the other reviews made it out to be.  The dumplings and shrimp were next, the dumplings tasted like regular dumplings you could get at any Asian restaurant and the shrimp were average as well.  At this point I started getting a little nervous that we were about to spend a lot of money on a very average meal.

That all changed when they brought out the sushi.  This is the best sushi I've ever had in my life.  It's the best quality fish I've ever seen which made it worth every penny.  We had barely made a dent in our sushi when I asked for the menu to order more!  We got another himachi roll, another tuna roll, and a soft shell crab roll.  The only small complaint I have about the sushi menu is that it's very limited.  I wish they'd expand it a bit.

We ended our meal with a chocolate cake that was served with peanut butter ice cream peanut brittle and caramel sauce.  It was very good but I could only take a couple of bites because I was stuffed.  My husband didn't mind, he cleaned the plate!  I think if we hadn't been at a restaurant he might have licked the bowl.

The service at Roka Akor is amazing as well.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and knew every item on the menu like the back of his hand.  He was also really great about my husband's food allergy.  My husband is allergic to avocados.  He wrote on the ticket that my husband had a food allergy and double checked before our food was served. He also offered to take the sochu off of our bill since my husband didn't like it, we declined but it was still really nice of him to offer.   Our bill was $130 which isn't too bad considering how much food we got.  We will definitely go back, but next time we'll skip everything else besides the sushi.",review,1,Lra1XesEQl1kA3bEPLRiPg

I am not a fan of their ice cream machine, it is one of those where the ice cream is never really quite frozen enough, but they have other healthier desert choices.  

Prices here are reasonable, but beware of their ""uplift"" items.  Namely, the ""Premium Lemonades""....which are pricey and do NOT come with free refills.   They are tasty enough, but when you consider that you do not get a refill, it kind of sucks.  

It is a trade-off however as Sweet Tomatoes has free refills but pricier food...so who is to say.  

Anyways, I eat here quite often so I have no problem giving it three stars.  It is a good lunch stop or after mall selection, and a great way to eat healthy.",review,1,XgIhw-aWaq_Fx3ZVQGjnuA

Thursday evening right before a baseball game, there were people drinking and eating outside and insude. The places was pretty busy. 

How bad could it be?

UGGHH.... The server was wearing last years skinny shorts and was muffin topping out of them all over the place. She never refilled water, only came back after motioning to her, recommended shit food. 

I am a burger snob, so I ask before I order if the burgers are:

1. Good
2. Fresh not frozen
3. Can be cooked to med rare

Answers were:

1. Yes, they are excellent
2. Yes, hand pattied and fresh
3. Yes, but only to Meduim

So I get the burgers and frys. The frys were good. (got that out of the way)

Problems with the burger:

1. Worst burger i have ever had
2. fresh yesterday because it was a premade and cooked then placed in a juice of somesort, re-grilled on a flat op and burnt on one side only. It had zero flavor and was 1/2 mushy, 1/2 burnt.
3. was cooked all the way through like a freakin meatloaf

It was so bad i added salt 3 times and pepper 2 times. I still needed something to taste so i added the chili peppers from the pizza. 

Needless to say they took it off the bill. 

The other items we had was a Philly and there was about 1/2 the meat it should have. Pizza slice, was day old and rubbery. 

The drinks were served in cheap plastic cups like you get at a ""free drink "" special night in a nasty strip club or something. They were waek as shit too. 

Blah.....

The spaghetti squash and tomato sauce it was paired with was also wonderful. My boyfriends chicken was also cooked perfectly and came with mushrooms and a potatoe puree.

One really cool feature of this library is the children's section on the first floor.  Walk past the reflection pool, heading south and you'll find an extensive children's section.

Let me break it down for you. I love IKEA, I think they have a lot of great items, and are priced nicely. I also dig Scandinavian style, and profess a minimalist attitude towards all things.  So I get it, IKEA is cool for the most part, and I have a lot of stuff from this mega-store. What I don't like about IKEA is their physical store setup. I hate being forced into the ""showroom"" I don't want to walk Odin's path, or travel the way of the great Vikings Consumers of the past. I just want a curtain rod, and a curtain. THAT IS IT.  After fighting my way through the hordes of people and peasants alike, I fought my way through to the ""marketplace"" 

checklist out....(written in blood on a dried deer skin.)

1. curtain rod.
2. curtain rod attachments for the wall
3. oh.... don't forget the curtain

As I make my way past screaming kids, couples arguing over a Faux-Painting, and through the warehouse full of prefabricated, assemble required, plan about 4 hours on a Saturday to complete, furniture.I go to self checkout...Yes I am Free!! (1.5 hours later)

I did it!!!!!  I have my curtain I need. I will ""install"" this now as ""hang"" sounds gay. So I  install my curtain I realize, ""wow this helps to reduce the sun's infiltration into my soul, and think my other room would benefit from a curtain as well.  This means (insert Darth Vader March music here) another trip to IKEA....

This time however, I have a plan. I will go through the checkout area, through the warehouse, and totally bypass the showroom. Fuck IKEA, I am not a lemming easily led through a retail smorgasbord. Even if they had aquavit and salmon gravlax waiting for me, I'd still go through the Swedish ""backdoor"" 

I make my way in and repeat  the above 3 steps and I am out in 20 minutes. I have to say this must be some sort of world record. 

All in all, you can defeat IKEA, you just need to be sneaky and quick, you have to focus, and avoid any contact with people once in the store. Upon arriving home, I go to ""install"" this other curtain, and to really man-ify the situation, and to de-gay the whole weekend experience of shopping for ""window trimmings"" I put the Redsox   game on, (they won in 13 innings) and make it as ""tough"" of experience as installing a curtain can be.

Thanks Ashley for making it a painful and stressful process. 

I originally reviewed Yelp! and several of the typical AZ chain stores websites (Room Store, Mor, Ashley, etc.) Ashley seemed to have the best options (but no pricing) so I went there first. Ugh. Big mistake. 

First off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door. You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture. (Um, yeah, thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes with...I need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do, hopefully undistributed...) It's WORSE than buying a car. It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furniture...

I did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive. Like, overpriced expensive. I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there. However, at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements. 

I ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was ""the one"" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople).

Oh, and they don't include measurements on the item tag...I think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements, talking the ENTIRE time

Bottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy, but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around. The furniture stores I visited after Ashley (Razmataz, Mor, random other stores, had NORMAL sales people who asked you once if you needed help and then left you alone).",review,2,cSAACR699NuLMqBPuKL8nw

PROS:
----------
Friendly people.  Beautiful sunsets.  Beautiful desert scenery.  Cheap rent.  Beautiful weather 6mos out of the year.  Pretty decent Magic the Gathering scene.  Wonderful family.  

CONS:
-----------
A big percentage of people here are radical Christians and loony Mormons waiting for their spaceship to the planet Kolob (look it up).

There are a lot of chain restaurants and you've really got to search high and low for decent eats.  Unfortunately, most Phonecians enjoy Applebees over, say, a great Cajun eatery. 

The music scene is laughable, at best.  When the weekend's headline event is ""Hardcore is a Girl's Best Friend"", and when you go to a desert party with 2 stages of Hardcore, you know you're in trouble.  The city's DnB weekly draws crowds in the single-digits, and most events, sound-wise, are utter failures.  For instance, bringing out a huge UK DnB DJ then having the sound cutting out and clipping all night, awesome!  Want to hear Glitch?  bawahaha, good luck.  How about DubStep?  woooo!  If you're lucky you can catch the DubStep _monthly_... yes folks, 1x's a month.  Awesome.  There is literally only one weekly that's worth anything and it's the Pound which has been going strong for 1yr.  Sadly, you see the same 100 people at every event worth anything.  So in a city of 5million or whatever, 100 people know and support good music.  *sigh*  Want to hear a sick DJ like DJ Dan, Donald Gladue, DJ Icey, etc....?  Well you have 1 option:  wade through the sea of douchebaggery at Myst filled with the worst of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale wanna-be's with their $200 jeans and $150 bling t-shirts with no clue that a world-class DJ is on the decks.... THEN, you will be sadly disappointed as you watch your favorite DJ spin a watered-down set on a shitty sound system.  Sweet.

Art?  ""Hellz yeah we have First Friday"".  Yeah, 1x's a month, there's something artsy to do.  Tits.

Public transportation?  Yeah, the people of The Valley voted for the Light Rail project... a BILLION dollar debacle which provides Phonecians a single route from Mesa up to Phoenix, at a cost of $2.50 for a r/t.  Is it cheaper than driving?  No.  Faster than driving?  Nah.  More convenient?  Nope.  Does it go anywhere useful?  Naw.  It serves only a tiny fraction of our population, mainly those that find it ""hip"" to live in Downtown Phoenix.  How about the bus?  Don't know, I've never seen a bus in Gilbert.

Weather?  Miserable... you are forced to live in an artificial environment 6months out of the year because it's too hot to have a window open, too hot to even go outside.  Sure there's a lot of nice outdoors activities, but you can only participate 1/2 the year.   Don't let people fool you and tell you ""it's a dry heat"".  I don't care if it's dry or not, 117 degrees is 117 degrees.  OH, and don't expect it to cool down at night.... 100 degrees at MIDNIGHT is actually common.  And btw, it's not always a ""dry heat""... most of the summer is Monsoon season.  You actually begin to look forward to the monsoons.

How does Phoenix's weather effect your body?  Well, if you enjoy not being able to breathe, sneezing, watery eyes, bloody noses, burning your flesh on your leather seats, Valley Fever, and respiratory issues, Phoenix is the place for you!

Job market?  Awesome, if you enjoy working for a call center.

Cops?  Super!  We've got the anti-Constitution, racial profiling, show-boating, murdering Joe Arpaio.  If you are caught with even a roach or a stem of weed, you're looking at a trip to Tent City where you can enjoy our 117 degree weather from the comfort of an outside bunk bed under a canvas tent.  If you're brown and working hard to support your family, expect for your place of business to be raided, and for you to be arrested and detained, probably even deported.

Drivers?  The drivers in Phoenix are fascinating to watch and observe.  They paint the perfect picture of mental retardation.  Everyone tailgates here, going 70mph.  I defy anyone to drive 20miles on our freeway systems and not see a rear-end accident.  Multiple rear-end accidents happen daily.  Why?  Because people drive at 70mph literally inches from the car in front of them.  Now any person with an IQ over 70 would be able to understand that if the car in front of them has to stop suddenly, you are guaranteed to get into an accident.  GUARANTEED.

There really wasn't any service provided other than the owner leaning over and handing us two menus and a grunt for us to sit where we like. The bathroom resembled a south Phoenix shell station but we kept our wits and decided to judge the place on the food. A.G. ordered a tempura roll and three pieces of maguro tuna. I ordered the Katsu-don and water. If you are looking to fill your belly on sushi this is not the place to go. The menu is sushi lite with only a few standard rolls and a few types of sashimi and nigiri. The sushi that is provided is fresh but the rice falls apart and seems to be the wrong type for rolls and nigiri. The Katsu-don came with miso, salad, chicken skewer and a couple pot stickers.

This is my new favorite restaurant.

The three of us had different tasting menus pared with wine and for each course the sommelier brought 3 different wines and explained each one to us in great detail.  In between the 5 courses we were given 10 different little taste treats, so dainty we thought there must be an army of elves in the kitchen slaving for hours to make these things. When I do a tasting menu I want to enjoy as many different tastes as possible and I was not disappointed.  I had the foie gras, duck, ono and veal and everything was cooked and presented perfectly, the duck being my favorite.

It took me a long time to get here.  I kept reading about it and dreaming of the flavor combinations.  Finally, I decided to make the 30 minute drive from my hood to Sweet Republic.  My first time was about two months ago and since then I have been back a few times.  I'll find an excuse to run some errands in Tempe and then say. . .""well, we might as well go to SR, we ARE halfway there!""  

The ice cream is just as delicious as everyone says it is.  The flavors are amazing.  My favorite is the Espresso and the Salted Butter Caramel.  That is usually the pint I take home while I enjoy two scoops of something else while I'm there.  The Honey Blue Cheese is fantastic (if you like blue cheese), mix with the Date for a little sweet twist.  The Mint is a perfect fresh mint flavor and the Cabernet & Pear Sorbet is just like a wine slushy.  Next on the to-try list has to be the Chocolate Guinness and the Jameson.  You better believe I'm watching the FB status updates for those two!

During my first experience in the store, I was served by the smiley woman in all the press.  She was very friendly and let me try anything I wanted.  I couldn't have had a better experience.  After eating my two scoops I went back up to get my pint to-go.

Upon walking in, there are always a few Vietnamese men eating pho and socializing. It adds character to the place. The lights are bright and flourescent, none of that dim lighting ambiance. The decor is not exactly five star aimed accomedations, but who really cares?! We're there to eat gosh darn it!

This is a true mom and pop pho spot. It may not be fancy, but it feels surprisingly comfy. No snootiness, just good ol' pho. I would say the best pho I've had in Phoenix by a long shot! I love this place, the food is purely original. The shrimp fried rice was great as well. Not exactly a hole in the wall, the place is not that grimey, it's a bit cute I might add.

The herb crusted beef tenderloin is outstanding great cut of meat cooked to perfection. 
The Mediterranean stuffed chicken stuffed with artichokes, black olives and feta with a dill sauce and wild rice it is delish! 
I am not a big fan of Pesto but their Penne pesto cream is yummy. 
Also try the Thai Chicken skewers, Artichoke Croquettes, Louisiana Shrimp, or the Cracked Black pepper Calamari!

Ban Xeo (Pan-fried flour crepe with shrimp, pork, and bamboo shoots)

The Good News:
This is one of my favorite places to eat, I have become a regular here, and it is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to thus far in southern Arizona.
All of the entrees are always freshly and properly prepared.
The service is quick and about as friendly as it gets for a Vietnamese restaurant and the prices cannot be beat.
The crepe was cooked perfectly as was the meat and veggies inside, all of which were very tasty, and the serving size was plenty for two people.
The French bread was fresh, light, and flavorful, the egg was cooked just right for a sandwich like this, and the veggie toppings(carrots, onions, cucumber, and jalapenos) were a perfect accompaniment. My dining companion had originally decided against having a sandwich, but once she saw how much I was enjoying it she joined in and ate the other half.
The consistency of the rice porridge was just right (not too heavy or watery), there was ample portions of pork and all of the different seafood, and the serving size was plenty for two people.

The Rest of the Story:
The place is a bit run down outside and there always seems to be the usual suspect hanging out in front, but don't let that deter you.

A foodie website with lots of citizen reviewers is holding an event at your restaurant.  You go in knowing the people at the event will in all likelihood write reviews of your restaurant.

Do you:

A. Treat the attendees as if you are doing them a favor, run out of food early and generally put out the feeling that you would like the whole ordeal to be over as fast as possible so you can get these folks out of your establishment.

B. Seize the opportunity to put your best foot forward and capitalize on the opportunity to present your great food and friendly, professional staff to the reviewing community, in the hopes of receiving praise and business in return.

If you chose B you do not run Iruna.

To be honest, I am not privy to the negotiations and such that go on between Yelp and a restaurant hosting an event.  I do however have a solid grasp of business and marketing.

In my opinion, Iruna's behavior at the recent Yelp event reflected answer A above rather than B.  It was unfortunate.  

The food varied from good to mediocre.  I heard some folks got more than a few morsels, I'm not sure who they were.

I experienced attitude from staff members myself and witnessed a number of other people receive the same.  I was frankly quite surprised.  It was clear to me the staff did not grasp the opportunity they were presented with and viewed the event as a problem to get through.

As a contrast, I attended a Yelp event at The Breakfast Joynt over a year ago. The staff and management was pleasant and welcoming and the food was very good.  I have returned to The Breakfast Joynt 6-7 times since the event.

Also, it is more setup for a smaller lunch/dinner crowd and I imagine they get most of their business from take out orders.  Lastly, they cook the wings to order which take 15 minutes to prepare.  'Nuff said.

Now I have 3 reasons I love this place.  First, their wings are cooked to perfection.  They are juicy and cooked just enough to have that perfect crispness one should except from a chicken wing.  I've never had them screw it up the many times I've been there.  Second, their fries are delicious.  They remind me of boardwalk fries which you don't get around here much and they put what I think is a salt/sugar seasoning on them which is excellent.  Last but not least is their sauces.  While oddly bright red their regular hot flavor is well done.  The garlic parm is simple and delicious.  And my favorite and the most unique is lemon pepper.  It is oddly tangy and I can't figure out how they do it.

* Many condiments: Spice the meal to taste.

Bomberos is a place that's effortlessly cool and a surprising gem in the area.  For those that haven't been it's an old firehouse and the architecture and design is fantastic.  There's a large outdoor patio, as well as a fair amount of space inside.

Outside of some cheese/olive/meat trays, the menu basically breaks down to panini or bruschetta--with many of the same combinations.  I had both and my panini was a Spanish chorizo and was quite good.

Service was excellent, and wine selection is all South American.  If I had a complaint, I would say their price points are a bit high (at least by the glass).  Yes, I know they have to ship it ALL the way from another continent, but I'm pretty sure S American wine is relatively inexpensive from what I've bought.

Anyways, Bomberos is a great place to relax and enjoy some wine and company.  I was there on a Thursday with my aunt in from Seattle (which is a pretty cool city from what I remember) and she thought it was cool.  So yes, Bomberos is a cool place.  Check it out.",review,0,p8dSifN8MWzbygrSqoqOyA

Situated in the Mekong Plaza, the restaurant is attached an Asian market (which I wanted to explore after our meal!) and has an authentic feel to it.  We were promptly seated at a long communal table (different, but we didn't mind) and we ordered hot jasmine tea before we delved into the expansive menu.  

The tea was perfect and didn't have any jasmine leaves floating it (at Pho An Sen I was slighly irritated by this)--definitely my kind of tea.  We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pork to start.  I loved the warm tender shrimp and the crisp, fresh veggies.  They were served with peanut dipping sauce, and we experimented with the three sauces that were on our table (red chili sauce, hoisin sauce, sriacha).  

The menu was organized by broth: beef-based, chicken and pork-based, and regional flavors.  The server (I think he was the owner) asked if it was our first time eating Pho and took the time to explain the flavors of all of the broths.  I decided on the Pho with sliced chicken breast (it was listed under the beef-based section, although it was more of a rich chicken broth), and ordered it with bok choi, mushrooms, and broccoli.  It came with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime and basil.  The broth was complex, yet it had clarity to it.  It wasn't too oily (I HATE greasy-tasting Pho) and the chicken was lean.  Our server even showed us how to make the perfect dipping sauce (half hoisin, half sriacha and a squeeze of lime). 

My friend ordered the beef-based #3.  It was spiced perfectly, came out piping hot and wasn't loaded with fatty meat.  He ordered slices of rare beef on the side, which were very lean and incredibly tasty.  

On taste and service alone, I would have given unPhogettable five stars.  However, they closed at 9 on a Saturday night, and began to close up shortly after.  One of the waitresses propped open the door to shake out all of their floor mats.  This pissed me off because it was rainy and COLD outside, and it made both me and my Pho cold.  They started mopping and stacking the chairs before we even had a chance to pay.  It was like we were inconveniencing them for lingering at their restaurant.  This is one thing I HATE.

And I learned to spend what little money I made wisely. Fiscal conservatism rocks! Well, part of that meant finding a cheap and nearby place to wash my chonies and other clothes. Finding good eats was coincidental. Every Saturday morning, I'd set my VCR to record X-Men Generation, loaded up my Sportage with a week's worth of dirty clothes and headed to the laundromat at 48th and VB. Initially, I'd stroll on over to the Circle K during the wash cycle, get something that was certain to introduce me to my toilet after the spin cycle and that was about normal. One day, I bravely headed north and stumbled upon Phx House of Pizza and Subs. Like a mirage in the desert, it called out to me with intriguing smells of delishness. It was lust at first sight. The 2 slices of pizza would keep me filled until afternoon and were amazingly tasty. Truly, I found happiness.

And so it was, a Saturday ritual whilest my clothing was being laundered I succumbed to the garlicky goodness that is PHOPS. Sadly, I found love and moved to the other side of town and it seemed I was watching an endearing lover grow smaller in my rear view mirror as I drove on. :sigh: I did know what good, economically-friendly dining was.

The first was on St. Patrick's Day, shortly after the Flogging Molly concert at Tempe Beach Park let out...obviously this place would be busy.  We had to wait quite a bit to get the attention of the server, but the place was packed, so I can't hold this against them too much. 

The bruscetta and pizza we got was amazing, one of the better pies I've ever tasted.  With an extensive beer selection and full bar, with relatively competent bartenders that seemed to be able to keep up with the demand for drinks and extended hours, this seemed like a great place for a late night snack and nightcap.

The following week, we return on a Wednesday, about 2 hours before closing time.  We sat at a booth in the bar area and were met by a server relatively quickly.  Our order was taken and drinks brought out, only to find out that they are only doing slices of pizza at the time, not making any new ones...We figured we'd try it out and get a couple of slices with some pretzles to even it all out.  After finishing our slices and waiting for an extra 10-15 minutes, we finally flagged down the waitress and asked about the pretzles, she mentioned that the kitchen wasn't cooking anything new.

We also asked one of the bartenders (who may or may not have been a manager), when they killed the menu for future reference, and was told about 10 or 10:30 they went to slices only of whatever they had available (in a rather rude tone for someone addressing two of maybe 8 customers in the whole place...).  After eliciting our disappointment, they offered to comp our drinks, which were the most expensive items we ordered, which made the visit managable but still very disappointing.

Bottom Line:  Go for lunch, when it won't be too busy, and you'll have a chance at being treated properly.  After about 10pm or so, just go to Slices.",review,1,2tyadgcxcaEu5LWgLdwLAQ

Yeah when we parked we had to walk by some kind of club (in Glendale?) that actually had a red carpet...who knows?

Anyways...
I drove past Corbin's the other day on my way to Thunderbird park and told myself that I really wanted to try the place. On that very day, one of my best friends said she tried it and thought that my boyfriend and I would like so when it came time to decide on a dinner spot on Friday we opted to try something new! 

One of the many great things about Yelp is that it has actually enhanced out dining out experience because we start talking about my review the moment we sit down. 

Corbins has good intentions but the best phrase I can use sum up the place is 'Non-synthetic.' From the warehouse style ceilings to the bar that takes up half of the restaurant space to the only 3 comfortable looking booths, Corbin's really is lacking. 

Onto the food- 
The menu looked alright, resembling your typical bar/grill food. My boyfriend wanted to sample the onion rings and like Maggy said, these greasy rings seemed to be the best part of the menu. I tried to fight it but ended up trying 2 and yes they were good, and greasy. For our meals, I went with the Mediterranean salad with chicken and B went with some kind of chicken sandwich. My salad was really good and really fresh actually but B really did not enjoy the sandwich. On the way out of the restaurant we actually both felt sick. B said, ""Remind me not to order chicken sandwiches when we go out in the future."" Not really the first comments you want after dinner. 

Why 2 stars? The service was awesome. I don't remember his name but he was awesome and always kept out glasses full and did not slip on my salad, even with all the alterations I had.

Let me say, there is a reason I've never heard of this place.

This is a coffee shop that seems to exist because someone thought it would be an easy way to start a business, not because someone was actually interested in serving good quality coffee.

I will keep it short and devote my post to giving you my main qualms about Dolce.

1. The coffee was badly roasted and bitter. I don't know where they get their beans (maybe I don't want to know), but the coffee was of lowest quality and showed a lack of regard for the industry. If you're a coffee shop your main purpose is to have good coffee.

2. My iced latte was littered with coffee grounds. There should NEVER be bits of coffee in your coffee drink. At my first sip, the latte was so horribly bitter and burnt tasting I wondered why it tasted like smoke... it was the coffee grounds being sucked up through my straw and onto my palate. Even when I isolated the problem, pulled up the straw and tried my latte without shards of coffee... it wasn't good (hence point #1).

3. The ambiance is that of a nightclub trying to be a coffee shop. There is a time and place to watch Lil' Wayne music videos... and that time is not when I want to try to enjoy my horribly bitter latte. The couches were old and ripped and looked like rejects from someone's old bachelor pad.",review,0,7o8ftQox8Usmik734CwGcQ

I actually used to shop here quite a bit, but then moved down South, where it becomes much more of a trek to get to a Whole Foods. I've moved back up North, and now I can shop at this store again!

I went shopping here tonight, and I remembered why I love Whole Foods so much. All you have to do is look at the butter section understand why Whole Foods is so amazing. I counted at least 15 different kinds of butter, and each of them was unique in some way. At some point or another, I've tried each of them, and the more expensive, specialty brands are far superior to the regular butter you'd find on the shelves of most other grocers. I love Keri Gold Irish butter, which I get at Trader Joe's, but there are even better varieties of butter here. For people who are not familiar with the different varieties and qualities of butter, it may be a bit confusing to have so many different choices, but any of the butters here will do you just fine in any recipe. If you're making a special butter sauce for a hot date one night... I'd suggest that you splurge for one of the premium (and very expensive) butters. Just use it sparingly.

On the staple items: milk, bread, flour, etc, Whole Foods has reasonable prices, in line with other grocers (maybe not in line with other grocers' sale prices, but in line with the standard prices). If you want high-end specialty items, the nice thing about Whole Foods is that you can find them. The bad thing is that, if you love food like I do, you'll constantly be tempted to splurge on the better food items because... well... they're just sitting there, and on any particular item you think to yourself, ""it's not THAT much more, and it's SO much better..."" ... then you check out and realize that your quality-loving palate has spent you into debt on your weekly grocery shopping. My advice: go in with a plan on what you're going to get, and don't splurge on the high-end products unless it's a treat for yourself (and don't talk yourself into treating yourself on every item!), or you've got some ridiculously hot date who you're trying to impress.

I love the attitude of the people who work at the stores, and I love how responsive the store is to customer needs/wants. Several months back, I noticed that Whole Foods was getting low on Valrhona chocolate (which was the chocolate of choice at L'Orangerie Restaurant... and became a favorite of mine). I inquired about the low levels of chocolate, and was informed that they were discontinuing that product line in favor of another, lesser quality (in my mind) brand. I complained at the time. I came home with a bar of Valrhona chocolate tonight. Thank you, Whole Foods!

I love that when I buy fish they are not only happy to give me ice, but they expect that some people will ask (note: you should ALWAYS ask for ice when you buy fish), and they quickly and pleasantly retrieve ice for you. AND, when you check out (at least, here in ridiculously hot Arizona), they ask if you need ice for your groceries for the ride home. What service!

Interesting tidbit: Did you know that Whole Foods lets its employees at each store decide the decor of the store? That's why you'll find Whole Foods in some neighborhoods to be far more college-towny, while others, like this particular location (Scottsdale Rd &amp; Mayo) are very upscale. The stores are designed to the tastes of the residents surrounding the store... and Whole Foods corporate figured out that free market principles work: the corporate office has no clue what those of us in Scottsdale want our store to look/feel like... the employees who live around that store most certainly do. They delegate that job, and the result is that each store is slightly different, and caters to the people who are going to shop there: the locals.

I was convinced that I would miss my connecting flight because the one hour layover time i scheduled was reduced to a mere ten minutes. I ended up making the flight though, because it too was delayed. My return trip was also via Washington National and would involve a 1 hour layover. True to form, my flight to DC was delayed to the point that my time between flights exactly 30 minutes. When I told customer service that this was insufficient time to take a shuttle bus between terminal buildings and make my flight I was brusquely told that 30 minutes was a legal layover time and that nothing would be done for me. Of course it ended up being a moot point as the flight was soon delayed again. This caused me to miss my connecting flight and forced me to wait for 8 hours for the 10 PM flight to Manchester.     As I mentioned above, I normally fly southwest; this was my first US Airways flight in some time. Based on my experiences it is not at all clear that any US Airways flights actually leave on time.

The sauce did not overtake the dough as it was light tasting and just enough to cover all areas of the pie.  The cheese had the right amount of cheesiness!  Overall, it was very well balance!  The portion was just right.  Just about any grown adult could finish this in one sitting!

When it comes to pizza, I typically order something really simple.  What I just described was their Margherita, simply cheese and sauce!  With that said, I could not be more pleased and satisfied!

Everytime I turn around or have one little bit of doubt of staying, some new amazing place opens in Mill Towne Center. Aloha is no exception.

After hearing about it from Loveland, I took a break from cleaning yesterday and walked there with a friend and her dog. I was anticipating these flavors I was told about, which I believed were too good to be true. I mean snickerdoodle is my favorite. cookie. ever. but a yogurt flavor.. no way.

From the minute we arrived we were welcomed. It was nice. My friend's dog was given a bone to enjoy while he sat outside. Definite bonus points there. We were each given a couple cups to sample some flavors first. I was pondering the base of my creation... snickerdoodle or pineapple. Both were excellent. I finally decided on Snickerdoodle mixed with cake batter, thinking it would be a good combo. I also added some almonds and reese's peanut butter cup.

I was shocked at how low the price was and how delicious it tasted. The cake batter was okay and the snickerdoodle was phenomenal. However, next time I think I need to add more almond. It completely hit the spot and I think my punch card may just be full before long. I mean, since I'm walking there and back it means I can go more than I told myself I could right?

The decor in the place isn't that bad for me. I think the couch idea is great, but I'd love to see more color in there.. maybe mix in some yellows or other tropical tones and not be afraid of using some white :)

I'm also hoping for some other toppings such as coconut, and maybe some pineapple. Curious about what flavors are to behold. Banana? Now banana, pineapple, raspberry would be a great combination!!

Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. 

Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is ""The Heart Attack Grill"" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. 

Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said ""that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth"". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. 

The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.

P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger.

Thursday, Dec 23rd, 9:15 pm.  Busy.

Parking not so good, some tard parked in two spaces (light silver Nissan Altima circa. 2005-2007 model, you know who you are); I wanted to smear something like dijonaise sauce all over on his/her car, but seeing as it was Xmas and all...
 
There were many hipsters (I thought it was the National Hipsters Convention Phoenix 2011 at first), and I was worried the food would be pretentious and small portions, fortunately, that was not the case.

Seated right away, water right away, you will never get dehydrated here, they are constantly filling your glasses ( a + no matter what ).

Got nice Xmas pint of something beer, and ordered.  Pints were perfectly priced at $5.  Actually the prices were very reasonable IMO.

Started with the Bruchetta board (order of 4, you choose), an apple and fig one (OMG!), a Salmon one, a salami one, and one other, at first bite my fears of hipsters and small pretentious food quickly slipped away.  I am new to bruschetta, and I have to say, it was one of the best things I have ever had, and that bread, I would have bought a loaf if they sold it.

Next up, Potato and cheddar soup, amazingly good.  I made the mistake of getting a bowl, and all that bruschetta, and then ordering a pannini, I guess it was a rookie mistake, because with that bruchetta board they give you a lot of food, which is well worth the price.

Tried the pannini with bacon and chicken (sorry forget the name), no matter it was great.  Again, I ordered too much food.  But you only live once ( I hope ).

Service was very very efficient, I have never seen tables bussed that fast once someone leaves, it takes seconds, and it seems like that former patron was never even there only moments ago?  We had a couple hipster servers with the sensitive beard thing going on, but they were very good at what they do, and very pleasant, and again, efficient.

It was a bit noisy in there, and pretty chilly too.  Seems like they keep some door to the bar area open, but after a couple beers you get used to it.  I imagine it is necessary as it gets so packed in there?  Oh cool bathrooms too.

I would totally go back, it was amazing.  For a moment I thought I was in Seattle or Portland and not here.  Great progress for Phoenix, I must say.  Actually, I will be back very soon.

I will just go there late, to avoid the rush.  No matter, I was quite impressed with the food, highly recommended!!


Actually, it was one of the best things I have had in some time!

Oh, the hipsters were not so bad in retrospect, and they really seem to love bruschetta?

Here's why I think this place got 3.5 stars. Their menu caters to too many groups of people. I would consider the atmosphere and decor to be on the higher end, but if you look at the menu, they have burgers for 12 bucks and a filet mignon steak for 30. While the the old farts around me are trying to enjoy their steak dinner and have a classy conversation, you have me, the jack a-, ordering the burger, talking about Linsanity and eating with my hands. 

They made me uncomfortable and I'm sure I didn't make their dining experience any more pleasant. But you know what? J. Alexander's make tasty food. I went with the Turkey burger with all the fixin'. My classier counterpart- of-a-wife ordered the filet mignon. My turkey burger was well made; juicy and full of flavor. It was topped in fresh baby arugula, tomatoes and wrapped in a fresh baked bun. It also came with a mountain of made to order French fries. Wifey's steak was well made. Her hunk of meat was tagged on all sides with grill marks and looked very presentable. The steak was tender and well seasoned. It also came with a loaded baked potato, which went nicely with the steak. My only complaint is that the potato was twice the size of the steak. I think it should be the other way around. 

Overall, I would recommend this joint as a second or third date. It looks nice, good is good, and the prices aren't too steep. 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.",review,3,RKDSCRbN17rlE4ayYiyEqw

I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but ""butterburger"" and ""frozen yogurt"" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.
Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.
The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8"" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the ""value basket"" deal.
Their frozen yogurt or ""concrete mix"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their ""brownie cookie dough"".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! 
Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating.",review,1,TVMLSvdYuHK3BOwh-kafRQ

I lived in Arizona for 10 years and was there when this place opened its doors in 1998.  It is a cafeteria type of set up, but is well worth the wait.  I just got back from a trip to Phoenix and I had to have this place twice!

All the food is freshly prepared.  The beef brisket is to die for.  In fact, so are the ribs, turkey, pork and chicken.  The secret is their smoker.  The have a huge wood burning smoker that they burn pecan wood in.  The pecan flavoring is second to none!.

The sides are all freshly prepared too.  They have potato salad, mac -n- cheese, pit beans, sweet corn, etc., etc.  The best side is their cheesy potatoes.  They are really cheesy with a little kick.  YUMMY!!

My wife always gets their jumbo  baked potato with meat.  Where do they get these spuds?  They're humongous!

They have fountain drinks (Coke products) and they make their own root beer.  If that doesn't tickle your fancy they have bottled Stewart's soda and bottled water.

The staff is generally friendly and the surroundings are clean.  The place is decorated in a nostalgic theme depicting a time when Gilbert was all farm land as far as the eye could see.  There is an old refurbished farm tractor in the middle of the restaurant.  Gives the place a ""hometown"" ambiance.  

On a Spring or Summer night you have to sit outside.  It is decorated as if it was a family cookout complete with Christmas type bulbs atop the acre of lawn.  It's really cozy.

The drawback to this place is that it is popular and therefore very busy.  Especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  Expect to wait a bit, but it is well worth it!

My wife and I moved back to the Bay Area in 2004 and lament losing our favorite BBQ joint, but it makes our yearly visit to her Mom's place all the more sweeter because at least two or three times I'm going to Joe's REAL BBQ!",review,2,ybiaI9DK8Mx3NHtE6FepQw

we confirmed with them numerous times what would be the right procedure to get a ceritifcate (we dont mind if they said yes or no , with whatever they find and if they think i was unfit  to fly), so we left since they said we should be able to fly under 36 weeks with no problem, but when we got home and checked the website for cathay pacific they required a medical certificate if you are at 27 weeks and 6 days.
so i received a miss call the next morning and called back and was directed to the office manager NICOLE W. and she started going off that our intentions are wrong and how we refused to pay 1600 for the visit (when all we did was clarify how much would a wellness visit be) and that we are not going to jeoperdize their practice and how we are trying to trick them to sign a document and end up being liable if anything happens, and that (here goes) YOU CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THIS IN THIS COUNTRY... and i was in shock when being attacked that way and how she had witnesses on the trouble we did at the doctors office the day before and she has witnesses, i was appalled because this was all false, my sister has been seeing the the last 3 years  and how they made that judgement call surpised us. then she said you sound like your smart and you know what you are doing so you should know how this works, what got me was i am not the doctor here i am a patient that is why the past month a half i called to clarify these things because "" I AM NOT A DOCTOR"" money is not an object we dont mind paying if we have to , if i am not able to fly and will ahve to deliver here that is fine, i am a cash paying patient and have no intention of using any state medical assistance of payment plans with them if the time came i would have to deliver in phoenix. Then Nicole goes off i cant keep repeating myself this conversation is over and hangs up.
so i have consulted with my sisters attorney and we are filing a complaint against them with the az medical board and the attoney general . 
on the brighter side we spoke with arrowhead oby gyn and they will gladly accept us and make any assesment possible, and they are going to take me in this afternoon with no problems so we can make any necessary arrangements if a flight needs to be cancelled.
i am disappointed with what happened , you would think educated individuals would handle the situation better and in a more professional manner. all she had to do was take a breathe and approach the situation , i think being condescending is not the way to solve a problem. 
i hope all can understand where we are coming from , i felt like a 90 mph fast ball came at me out of nowhere, and all we wanted to to was ask what would be a good idea and they just started making biased conclusions against me.

The bar staff is pretty laid back,  the security staff is kind of ego-maniacal meatheads that kick people's asses for no reason.  When i went to The Germs show someone got their nose broken.  Lots of blood.  Which, typically would be a normal scene for a punk rock pit but it was inflicted by the security simply because the kid told him to F off.

Liquor is kinda expensive but decent specials on various nights.  usually reasonable cover charge for bands which is nice in this economy. The usual bar games, i want to say they are free during certain times . . . not sure on that tho'.",review,2,eEo1W07PkjR0jLRkMF5m1g

A lot of people have suggested that I try Lucille's but my desire to do so had been low. Probably because from the outside it looks like just another overpriced family restaurant. Now that I've been inside, it kind of gives you that impression when you walk in, too. There's a decent decor, but there's also all that junk on the wall that gives it an Applebee's kind of feel. Long lines to get in (mostly due to huge parties) also don't help out. 

Fortunately, the food is really good. 

You get biscuits with a side of maple butter which is quite enjoyable. We started with a half order of onion straws. Unless you're with a big group stick to the smaller size. Even though these fried strips of onion were addicting and hard to stop eating, it was still too much for just two people. The BBQ ranch sauce its served with is also really good (and I am not a big ranch fan). 

Both my girlfriend and I had sandwiches as our meals. I went with the brisket and portabello with honey roasted peanut slaw. The brisket was wonderful. Not too soft like most places tend to serve it when in sandwich form. Can't say that I was a big fan of slaw. Nothing special about it, and the vinegar in the recipe just didn't do it for me, and the peanuts didn't add anything to the flavor, they just felt thrown in. 

My girlfriend had the Smokehouse sliders with BBQ chicken. While they give you the option of pork, chicken, or brisket, Lucille's doesn't let you mix and match which you want. I really don't get that policy consider there isn't a price difference between the meats. It's not like they're smoking it up on order (and if they are, there's a big problem considering it takes hours to smoke meat). I guess it's too hard to the kitchen staff to grab from two different places. Either way, she enjoyed the chicken. She had a side of sweet potato fries which were really good. 

Like most Barbecue chains, Lucille's pimps its own sauces. The three that were brought to the table were original (the best; loaded with flavor), Hot and Spicy (neither hot or spicy, not bad, just not close to what I was expecting), and Memphis style (I'm not familiar with Memphis style barbecue, but this was pretty much just ketchup). I recommend sticking to the original. 

We chose to sit in the bar (open seating and full menu) to avoid a short Sunday night wait and watch the basketball game. There's four big TVs placed across the bar, but someone did a very bad job placing them in their spots. There's a couple of support beams in the room which block the views. We easily found a seat that allowed us to see the game were were interested in, but my view of the TVs playing the baseball game were blocked.

Overall, the place isn't much to look at, but the food is good.",review,0,thdVzCfKx-DV0zYWqId3pw

Pros:
-Great ambiance. From the bar to the patio to the dining room to the restrooms, this is a beautiful restaurant. It was almost enough to make me forget I was dining in a shopping mall and is very different from all of the other steakhouses in the Valley. 
-Chopped Salad. The GF and I both declared this was the best chopped salad that we've had in PHX. Pretty unique and really tasty. We both said we would go back and eat this and some apps at the bar in the future.
-Pretty good wine list. Not the best in town, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had super low expectations in this category due to my experiences with other Fox restaurants, but the wine list here exceeded my expectations. 
-Oysters. High quality Fanny Bay oysters. We love good oysters and these were very good. Granted, the kitchen doesn't do a whole lot to prepare raw oysters, but Modern Steak has a very good supplier when it comes to their oysters.

Cons:
-Arrived at 8:10p for a 8:15p reservation. Hostess said it would be ""closer to 8:15p"" before we were seated. It wasn't until 8:40p that we were seated and there were several empty tables in the dining room when we were seated. I know they might not have had staff for these tables, but what's the point of a reservation if they don't seat you until nearly 30 minutes past your reservation?
-My steak was cold. Cooked perfectly, but stone cold. I knew it was a bad sign when the steaks were delivered 10 seconds after our salad plates were cleared. They were obviously sitting at the window for a long time before they were sent out. When you're paying more than $40 for a steak, it shouldn't be stone cold. I mentioned this to our server and she said that she would tell the chef. She offered to take it back to the kitchen and cook it some more, but that would defeat the purpose of ordering a medium rare steak if they had to cook it to medium or more just for it not to be stone cold. Other than that interaction with our server, nothing else was said about the chilly steak. No visit from the manager, no offer to comp dessert, nothing. And this was on a table that spent $289 for dinner for two. 

The quality of the meat was pretty good, but you can get better steaks at City Hall, J&G or BLT for about the same price. Sides were decent (brussels sprouts and mac & cheese), but nothing that absolutely rocked my world. in the end, we decided Modern Steak isn't a place we would go back to for a full dinner since there are other much better steakhouses in town. Instead, next time we'll hit up the bar for happy hour, get the chopped salad, some apps and a few cocktails and call it an evening. That way we can avoid the cold steaks and lackadaisical attitude towards reservations and customer service.",review,2,4kfvccmKDUgCXu_jLYm5dQ

I'd give the salad a 3.5 because it didn't take my breath away, but it is better than your average. There is corn, carrots, avocado, and fresh tomatoes inside. There is sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and it brings a nice touch. 

Oyster - I'd give 3 stars. It tastes a bit salty. After eating some of the best oysters in New Orleans, this one is just not up to par. It looks pretty, but it tastes like the type of oysters are picked from salty water, not fresh ones. Don't get the oysters, save yourself for some of the best. 

Everything here is well priced. The burger is a bit bigger than an in-n-out burger. The sides are bit burned and if I had to choose, I'd spend the extra few buck to purchase a burger at Joe's Farm grill. Service here is impeccable with fancy silverware.

I'd give this place 4 stars because the bread is the sole reason to come back.",review,2,SNH5L8QZ4kT9unURQUrYow

I feel I have to address a couple of the reviews that have been posted here.  First, there is Nadia's odd review about how ""gross"" for raw meat to be bloody.  Well, last time I checked, meat has blood.  Apparently she prefers frozen meat over fresh meat.  To each her own, but it seems a bit absurd.  Second, Jennifer ""reviewed"" the place without having actually eaten there, which strikes me as a bit closed minded and presumptuous.  I don't have the intuition to be able to judge a restaurant based on bowl size alone, but maybe she is just more talented than I.

On to the actual review... Genghis Grill is great.  Like I said, the meat is fresh, and there are several options: steak, chicken, turkey, pork, sausage, scallops, shrimp, cod, calamari, and probably some that I'm forgetting.  Oh, and did I mention that none of it is frozen?

After the meat, you are hit with a wide array of seasoning selections (Ashley mentioned that she would prefer sauces.  Apparently she didn't realize that there are also sauces at the end.).  Seasonings are necessary because they enhance the flavor, which is something that YC's could use.  My favorite is the Cajun seasoning.

Next you hit a wide variety of vegetables and other knicknacks.  There are almost too many choices; I have a hard time narrowing them down.  It also allows for different combinations; not all of your bowls have to be exactly the same each time.

Finally, you get to the sauces.  These sauces actually have flavor.  

You also get a choice of what you want in the bowl with the stir fry; options include noodles and fried rice.  

They also have strawberry lemonade, one of the rare restaurants with such an offering.

It is true that this place costs a little more than YC's, but it's worth it.  To those who say the bowl is small, sure, it's smaller than YC's, but when you add the rice or noodles, it fills you up, and you are limited at YC's by how much crap food you can stand to stomach.  There might be better Mongolian BBQs which I don't know about, but this place is legit.",review,0,KYeLSM3MQpirmHukVV5Iow

To begin with our friendly server suggested a wine - we were surprised to learn it was a pricey $12 a glass. And my lunch buddy said he didn't particularly like the wine either.  Be sure to check the wine list BEFORE ordering.  

A warm basket of bread was brought to the table. However, the bread was not chewy or tasty but had an odd cakelike texture.

I was expecting a hearty minestrome soup.  This was not hearty - a thin, bland tomato broth with lots of pasta.  Adding some grated parmesan gave some flavor. Olive Garden's pasta fagioli soup is 100 percent better.

I had the seared salmon over curly pasta in a light creamy sauce.  It was tasty probably due to the crushed red pepper I asked for.  Leftovers that I removed from my frig the following day were rock hard.  I guess the sauce wasn't all that light - probably lots of cheese and butter.  My buddy liked his pork panini although the huge leaves of rapini made for messy eating.

Had to try the Italian ricotta cheesecake but wish I hadn't bothered.  It was a big slice, bland and flavorless - 8 dollars a slice!  Lately other restaurants are offering smaller desserts which I like - less calories and cheaper.

That being said, this is by far the best Thai food in the Phoenix, and surrounding, areas. My first experience was after having a tooth pulled. I needed to eat, but it needed to be soft, and I was craving Thai. So my amazing partner ran over and grabbed me some Pad See Eew and an order of crab  puffs. 

The Pad See Eew was the best I've had outside of Bangkok. The flavours were perfectly balanced and it absolutely reminded me of home. They weren't stingy with the protein (chicken) and it didn't seem to be an Americanised version of one of my favourite Thai dishes. And the crab puffs... My partner had a couple and her response to them was, ""These are the best crab puffs i've ever had!"" Not your usual wonton wrapper stuffed with cream cheese with virtually no crab, these are filled with cheesy, crabby, seasoned goodness. So much flavour packed into such a little pouch. And they're served with a sweet chili sauce for dipping. 

The second time we ate there, we actually went to the restaurant. It was around 3:30pm on a Saturday so we were pretty much the only people in there. I ordered a Thai iced tea and my partner got a green tea. My Thai iced tea was perfect. Not to sweet, unlike many of the other Thai restaurants I've been to. The green tea was a little strong, and my partner says she's just going to get water from now on. Not because the drinks are bad, but because unlike the majority of restaurants, they serve purified water. Not tap water. MAJOR brownie points there! 

We, of course, started out with the crab puffs, which were just as good as the first time. I ordered yellow curry with chicken, and my partner ordered the cashew chicken, both Thai hot. Ordering food ""Thai hot"" can be hit or miss. Many places see the ginger hair and pale skin and figure they can dumb down the Thai hot and I'd never notice. F*ck that! When I say ""Thai hot,"" I mean ""Thai hot!"" And that's exactly what we got. 

The cashew chicken was phenomenal. The smell alone brought back to living in Bangkok and eating at the noodle shop across from my school. It was spicy enough to make my nose run and leave that warm, tingly feeling in my mouth and throat but still had incredible flavour. My partner said it was ""amazing."" (She's not quite the foodie I am, so for her, that's a high compliment.) My curry was pretty damn good, too. Spicy, flavourful, full of large pieces of chicken as well as all the other good stuff (potatoes, carrots, etc). I could smell it as soon as it was set down and I knew it was going to be hot, and I wasn't disappointed. We had enough left over to take home and have for breakfast the next day. The portions are more than generous.

Our server was extremely attentive. Almost overly so, but I was glad for that as opposed to being practically ignored, which can happen when you're the only patrons in a restaurant. He came over at least twice to make sure our food was ok, and always made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed, ie. napkins, more tea, water, etc. 

Being so stuffed I didn't get a chance to try their mangoes and sticky rice, but it's on my list since it's one of my favourite foods ever! 

The menu is extensive, with all sorts of noodles, stir-frys, curries, etc you can imagine. They have a lunch menu served daily til 3pm (including weekends) that have the same dishes for $6.75, which is what we plan on shooting for next time.

2. The kitchen was down and they had no food? What?!  That is just unacceptable. 
3.  On top of no food....the tap was out of order. Yep...no beer on tap.  This is just getting out of control now. 
4.  The smell of sewage....never a crowd pleaser. 
5.  The music was like nails on a chalk board....distasteful techno-pop garbage sound. 
6.  Can the servers smile?...just one smile....please? damn! get over yourselves. 
7.  Watered down HH Margaritas? Check! 


I have been told by many that this is the ""sunday"" spot because of bottomless mimosas and the large crowd.  If I had to see more of this crowd I think I would die of laughter.

Really? Two words to sum up this place - NO FLAVOR. Listen, this was the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. I am usually an over-orderer and an over eater when pizza is involved. Here, we didn't finish our food and left hungry. 

The service was annoying, but that wasn't the problem. I am giving this place 1 star because it was seriously the WORST pizza I have had. That was worth saying again. The worst. 

The salad we started with is big enough to share with a few people... we wanted to like it, but it was oily and greasy and just very sub par. I am not going to say something was good just because it was big. 

The pizza... oh, the pizza. Thin crust - slightly burned and with NO flavor. The pizza itself had NO flavor. We both agreed that we could have opened up a can of tomato paste and smeared some around and had the same effect. No flavor. None. The cheese was haphazardly spread thinly and again - no flavor. It felt like mass produced cheese. No flavor. We got onions and garlic on the pizza as our toppings - and thank god we did, because that was the only thing that had any flavor.... and even then, not much. My partner resorted to dumping Parmesan on the pizza. Translation - it was bad and tasted like NOTHING. 

The prices - for what you get, meaning the quality - NOT good. You start by ordering a cheese pizza base - red sauce, white sauce or pesto. And you pay at least 2 bucks for each additional topping. We ordered the ""small"" pizza (really their medium) and got just the two non-meat toppings: onion and garlic. We had that, the small salad and two soft drinks - the bill was around $50 bucks with a minor tip. WHAT? Really? We just spent that much and the food was this bad? 

As we walked out to the parking lot and we said we have several frozen emergency pizzas is our fridge. They all cost under 5 bucks, and they all have more flavor and would taste better than what we just ate. For real, and on the real. 

I wasn't expecting anything great, and I don't just give out one star reviews - but for the worst pizza and salad of my life, I just gotta go there. Save your money and order Pizza Hut.",review,7,NqeD28GGg1Wdj9BfaHqr4g

Good balsamic dressing

Sweet potatoes!

Cons:

-The pasta is generally over cooked
-The desserts are pretty meh

I asked the line staff how they prevent cross contamination to which she replied ""I dont understand what that means.""  Ok, fair enough, she isnt educated.  So I asked for a separate clean tong to use, even though I know that ""meat juices"" are already mixed in with the veggies.  She said they only have one for each container, and no extra clean ones.  At this point I was just too grossed out to eat.  My husband, being a carnivore didnt mind, but has been in the bathroom ""declaring war on Mongolia"" all evening, so I guess my theory could have been correct.  
We brought all this up to our waitress, as I would have like to have had dinner there, and she says its the corporate office's decision to have it that way, and had been asked this same question several times before. She mentioned that Muslims should absolutely NOT eat there, as there was NO way of knowing for sure if the food was cross contaminated with pork, and that the sign asking about ""allergies, and special dietary requests"" was a joke.

My personal favorite is the Rocky VII which is a juicy saute of either steak or chicken - I love the steak BTW, with mushrooms, onions, various peppers, provolone in a wheat tortilla. Complementing your wrap of choice is a pasta or fruit salad or the soup of the day. The pasta salad is another reason I come here! A salad with the right mix of freshness and tanginess. Very good.

Save room for dessert. Their dessert tray is to die for and they will bring it to your table so you can see everything on it and make your choice, then they will make you a fresh one of whatever you choose.

The yogurt is the usual frozen yogurt.  The only non-dairy choice I've ever seen there is the pineapple sorbet stuff.  I can't find a list of flavors online and it'd be nice to see a list posted in the window or something so I don't have to wander around the back of the shop to formulate a plan of attack.  

The topping bar has the usual add-ons, but the magnetized dispensers seem to always fall off in my hand as I'm trying to turn the handle to get the right amount.  About half of the time, I have way too much in the measuring cup below. What exaclty am I supposed to do with an extra half a cup of Oreo crumbs?  Leave them?  Dump them in my bowl?  Speaking of the Oreos, those dispensers are not a good match for things that are better left in chunks, rather than powder.  Same goes for the Butterfinger chunks.  Another suggested topping would be Mother's Circus Animal Cookies.  Now those, I'd happily take the extra half cup!

The 50s and car decor is not my thing, but the kids do love the swivel stools and trash cans.

Parking here is nearly non-existent. We walked far from a parking garage across busy roads to get to the building. Walking up to the front, the grounds were littered with trash amongst the overgrown weeds and potholed concrete. 

To get into the building we had to push through a crowd that had no attempted organization. There are no queues and no one directing any sort of a line.

When we reached the front of the line finally, we were told to take off our shoes outdoors. I saw several kids barefoot on the glass-strewn ground. Then a hideous troll groped me and told me to empty my pockets.

Once inside, there was a very foul odor. This couldn't be due to the current  human traffic because the event had not even started yet. I was immediately thankful we took our shoes off outside and not in here because the floor was filthy and sticky.

We went to get a drink before the show started and were met by the surliest bartenders I have ever experienced. The theater inside is exactly like being at a rave in an abandoned warehouse. So try not to think about the fact that you PAID to be here.

Let me start by saying you may want to write my review off as I am already not a fan of Vegas style clubs in very ""non-Vegas"" style cities, so already the shot for five stars was blown. 

We get there and it is way too crowded. Drinks were decently priced but I wasn't blown away by the ""friendly"" bar staff. As I turn around to face my friends, I feel a heavy, drunk arm around my shoulder and hear ""so, do you go to ASU?"" from a drunk man that was seriously invading my personal space. This is all fine as it is a club and I am just beginning while others may need to be switching to water....so I won't let that spoil my evening, but rather add to the humor. The music was really good, if you could get over the fact that right at the second stanza of every song began, the DJ mixed in something else and so I never got to hear a full song. As my buzz was allowing me to not care about the lame people and crowded room to the point of wanting to dance, a massive wave of vomit smell filled the room and I had to escape immediately. 

As I sit on the curb and wait with a few friends who also wanted to leave for my other friends who wanted another drink, the people watching got really entertaining. Drunk girls screaming obnoxiously at anyone who glances in their direction and a drunk man sitting on the curb telling all these women that they are whores really sewed up the night. As I tried to stay invisible so I could enjoy myself, the ""whore"" yeller stumbles over and says, ""did you go to college?"" yes, ""then doesn't it bother you that the people in that club are incredibly stupid"". No, I came to get a drink, not judge the IQ of the guy next to me. And I won't be coming back.

With that in mind, the Beautiful Carin and I, while we were out running a few errands today, were trying to decide what to do for lunch. 
Instead of the sandwich or late Sunday breakfast option, we were close to Humble Pie and decided to stop in. 
We hadn't been there in 3-4 months (one of the things I love about Yelp is that it pushes me to both try new places and revisit spots that I haven't been to in awhile).
It was not busy, which was both a blessing and disquieting. There should be more people there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon! 
The food is really very good, and the service was excellent (both better than the last time we were there, I think). 
I don't know if I attribute that to a less crowded place, or just improvements in everything, overall. I don't know and I shouldn't over-analyze.
We sat on the patio, and it is very comfortable and pleasant out there. This is a quiet corner of the Hilton Village strip mall, so it's easy to enjoy a conversation with out traffic and noise.
We had a sausage and roasted fennel pizza and veggie salad. Both were terrific! I prefer a more savory than sweet pizza, generally, and this one walked the line nicely. The tomato sauce and the roasted fennel have just enough sweetness to provide a counterpoint to the salty sausage and olives. Crust has a great texture and flavor, in and of itself, and was nicely baked, with just a little blackness at the edges. Nice Job!
The salad was extremely fresh and nicely dressed.

She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined.

Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... 

During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own.

Once the order was in the food started coming out at a nice pace. I will say everything should have been hotter. The kitchen is by the door and it was probably 50 last night. They is a constant slight breeze because of the outside seating and the doorway is open from the outside to the dining room. Lot of food on your plate, you wont be hungry when you leave but like I said, needs to be hotter..",review,1,EJaf8afUqC1xEV0BouExdw

I never feel rushed by him or the office staff and appreciate the measures they take to ensure I am comfortable and that I understand the agenda for my visit, equipment used, and costs involved. Their dedication to improving the quality of lives truly shines through in the care they provide.

The office is equipped with a full service optical store that boasts a hearty selection of frames. The frame stylists (I don't know their actual title) are friendly and knowledgeable in fit, style, inventory, treatments, and insurance coverage. Usually, I seek a unique frame that takes me some time to pick out. The stylists are not impatient and do not pressure you to make a selection, which I greatly appreciate. During my latest visit, I was unable to find a pair of sunglasses that I liked better than my current pair. The gal assisting me brought out a catalog and suggested a beautiful pair of sunglass frames that they did not have in stock, but could order. Unsure about how they might look on me, I inquired as to what happens if I don't like them. She said they would simply become part of their in-store inventory and I could make another selection, no big deal.

The sweet tea is great.  When you find sweet tea around here it is usually outrageously sweet, this was not, it was perfectly sweetened and was not too we.  The potato salad was also quite good.  

Now the bad:

The way this restaurant is set up is horrible.  It is probably a safe bet that you will spend as long or longer standing in line than you will actually eating.  If you happen to come during an off time, you may only have to wait twenty minutes or so to order your food.  If you show up during a busy period, there is no telling how long you'll be standing in line.  I understand that the food is all pre made and in theory it should be possible to quickly move people through the line and to their seats.  For whatever reason it really does not work in practice.  There has to be a better way.

I get it, Texans love the wax paper thing.  That's great.  Here's the thing; try ordering the prime rib, carry it back to your picnic table and start cutting it up with one of their plastic knives.  If you are anything like me, once your plastic knife has cut through the wax paper and rubbed your steak around on the bare table a couple of times you'll decide the best approach is to just eat the steak with your hands.  Granted, the wax paper and plastic cutlery probably works fine with the rest of the menu, but it doesn't work at all with the prime rib.  

Despite all of the issues, I will probably be back.  My wife had the ribs and they were quite good, and I am betting that the brisket is great as well.  The fact is, there just aren't that many good BBQ restaurants in the area.  The prime rib was a bad choice, and that choice is really what lead to the bad experience.  I look forward to a better visit next time.",review,0,FmwWPEQMcxCGI5K1yqAXaA
