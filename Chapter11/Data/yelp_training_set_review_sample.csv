Picture somebody you really like and want to be your friend saying these things in a really annoying dramatic tone; ""Oh my god, I have to have it right now!"".  ""This is the best thing on the planet!!""  ""Dude, you're insane if you don't love this.""  I bet you can guess what I'm referring to by now, it is indeed the infamous Grilled Cheese and Tomato soup ""snack"" bonered over by pretty much everybody I've ever met in CenPho.  Now I'll be honest, I've only been to the Roosevelt twice, and actually had a good time both times, but I had to give it 3 stars for a couple little nit-picky things, as well as the fact that I'm anti-bandwagon when it comes to sports, and food.  

Really?!  I had better tomato soup on Continental Airlines for christ's sake.  I am not a big soup eater, but I've always appreciated tomato soup for its dip-ability, and simplicity.  I dont need a full salad of basil in the soup, and honestly I found it kinda watery.  Again, maybe its just because of the people who its got bent over telling me how bomb it is, but all I could think was ""meh"".  

I can also cook a better grilled cheese with the bread from Tent City (don't worry about why I know what the Tent City bread is like) on a linoleum countertop with a clothes iron, while getting robbed, attacked by a wild boar (which I would subdue with the iron), and nagged by the super annoying chick that I mistakenly dated for a couple weeks last year.  I'm not a foodie, so I don't remember specifically what kind of bread and cheeses were used, but I do remember waaaay to much of said bread, and not nearly enough cheese, for 8 bucks.  8 bucks?!  Send me to Safeway, fuck that, Food City with 8 bucks and I'll make you a grilled cheese and tomato soup that will leave you begging for a cigarette.  

But I digress.  Actually, overall, I like the Roosevelt.  The high top tables were rickety as shit and the little candle on the table served more as a way for me to burn myself testing my manhood by holding my hand over it than a light source.  The place itself is cute, and I've always liked places that have a homey feel.  Our waitress was wonderful, and even gave us some in depth info on where they get some of their ingredients.  I have one more gripe, and it's that I was apparently an asshole for asking for a bourbon, and not knowing before I stepped inside that they only serve beer and wine.  The bartender looked at me like I was a moron (which she has every right to do b/c she's dead on) and told me to rethink my selection of Wild Turkey on the rocks.  I love Oak Creek, so I was pleased to see that they carried it, but I think they probably lose the business of some people looking for a cocktail.

So, I'm more than confident that you will enjoy the Roosevelt, but if somebody tells you that you'll never have a better grilled cheese in your life, go in with the mentality that they're just making sure that the chick/dude they're lusting after thinks they have good taste.  You'll never get her anyway broseph.",review,6,vXnfpkOK2djHNVsUxpSioQ

You can get some delicious appetizers and desserts to accompany the dozens of wines they serve. I recommend the cheese platter ($12.95), which consists of a generous portion of a variety of cheese, plus grapes, olives and crackers.

And the Caprese salad ($9.99) was a stellar portion of thickly-cut slices of mozzarella and beef steak tomatoes. This was one of the best-valued caprese salads I've ever had, and it tasted delicous.

Su Vino's obvious big draw is its wine. You can try a wine flight of five different types for only $10, and you can also purchase glasses and bottles.

Another cool thing you can do at Su Vino is bottle your own wine, complete with custom labels -- perfect for parties or special occasions.

I'm just getting around to Yelping it now, but I doubt anything drastic has changed. 

Me and a buddy of mine were trying to travel very cheaply. We camped out as much as possible, but decided to splurge on the $40 hotel here in Tempe. We didn't have much of a choice as it hit 110 degrees during the day and was a cool 85 at night. My expectations for a hotel are fairly basic in my opinion:

1. Clean enough to not find multiple bugs, have nasty smells, or stains anywhere.

2. Have a bed.

3. Have air conditioning (at least in Arizona in August)

The only thing that this Days Inn got right was having a bed in the room. But it wasn't even good enough to satisfy rule #1!!!

The receptionist wasn't very friendly when we checked in, but I could overlook this small feature. Again, it's not high on my list when I pay $40 for a room. After driving around to where our room was, it looked nice enough at first glance. We were just happy to have a place to get out of the furnace that was the outdoors. After getting inside, we crank the a/c full blast. Ahhhhh, finally some relief.... or so we thought. We waited for a while for it to cool down, but in the mean time all we could do was strip down to our underwear and just lie on the beds. But it never did start to cool down. It was just blowing some warm air. Strike #1.

Waiting for it to turn night so we could actually move around without breaking a sweat, we were watching some tv and I noticed a few crickets jumping around on the comforter on the bed. WTF? Strike #2

We decided to go out later that night because we had heard the Tempe nightlife was pretty good. It was all going good until we called it a night and came back to the hotel. We wake up early in the morning to check out and the bathroom is completely infested with ants all over the sink. Crawling over our toothbrushes, the towels, up and down the walls, we had had enough. Strike #3

I've never had problems with other Days Inn in the past, but I guess not every franchise has the same owners and rules. Definitely avoid this place like the plague.",review,1,lClvoNr2cNYM6hC_rG7yEg

Mostly stupid) and ate noodles every time I was forced to go there by my ex or my friends. Now I am pretty well-versed on the sushi world and eat it every chance I get.

No, RA is not the best sushi restaurant in town. No, it is not the most authentic. But it always draws me back in. The happy hour, the drinks (Umami Punch, you are my liquid soulmate), the special rolls...I can't help myself. (""I wish I knew how to quit you""...)

I WANT to hate RA, mostly due to the douchebags it tends to attract, at ANY of the locations (we live in 'Tukee now, so obviously we frequent this location a lot), but I still can't. We went a few weeks ago for happy hour with some friends, and it was busy (of course). No biggie, we sat at the bar and had a drink or two while waiting for our table. They told us 15-30 minutes and we realized it had been longer than that...went up to check on our spot and lo and behold, our buzzy-thingy was not working and they had skipped us on the list and because of this, have missed the happy hour cutoff. NOOO! I needed me some cheap dranks and sushi! We sat down, the waitress talked to the manager about what happened, and the manager came over and talked to us, apologized, and let us know any food we ordered (sadly not alcohol as well, but I understand why not) would still be happy hour pricing. Pretty cool, as some places would have had a pretty ""oh well"" attitude about it.

When I told him it didn't work he raised his voice in a ""are you stupid tone""? He repeated the spelling of the website which still didn't exist so I finally asked for him to fax a copy of the menu.

When I placed the order the next day I asked if they include paper plates and utensils to which he replied in the same ""are you stupid tone"" ""uhhh why would we do that? People either eat in our restaurant or they take the food home where they have plates and forks there.""  OK...

When I arrived to pick up the food at 4:00 like I said I would, no one was at the front counter.  An entire five minutes goes by and still no one.  So, I called the restaurant from INSIDE the restaurant until someone came out to acknowledge me. Turned out to be the same gruff guy from the phone who appeared to be the owner and manager.  Nothing was ready...not even the side salads. He disappeared and spent another 10 minutes preparing the food which came out to extremely small portions for the price.  I mean, each little ravioli cost around $2 a piece!  When he went to ring me up the final kicker ensued.  First, he charged me for 9 entrees when I ordered 7.  When I asked him to go over the itemized receipt he said ""what, you don't trust me?""  Ummm...hello...NO turns out I shouldn't trust you at all since you overcharged me for 2 invisible meals!  Then, without apologizing for his mistake, he rang me up again and this time charged me $1000.06 for my 7 meals. You read that  correctly - one THOUSAND dollars.  When I looked at the credit card bill before signing I pointed out his error and he replied ""No, it says 100 dollars.""  To which I was blown away.  I practically had to shove the bill in his face for him to accept his mistake.  Finally, 20 minutes after I was supposed to have left I finally had my overly priced food and paid the correct amount.

 i give Sugar & the Daddy's an A++ for the Bouncer's Decorative

I found it WAY too crowded and noisy for my taste, but I suppose that's a good thing for the restaurant's bottom line, and they probably wouldn't have it any other way.

The margaritas are cheap during happy hours, only 99 cents!

This place gives you complimentary chips + salsa + bean dip. The chips are crispy, fresh and tasty. The salsa and bean dip are not anything exceptional.

I tried the supreme nachos. It could've been better. They definitely put lots of toppings and meat on it. I felt like it was very greasy (but I expected it to be). It can be soggy near the end of the dish because all the cheese and meat soaks in it. The beef is just ground beef. Everything is stuck together so sometimes it is hard to share. It does come with a lot of ingredients on top like sour cream, guac, jalapenos.

The cheese crisp is interesting. It reminds me of a tortilla pizza with just cheese on it. Nothing exceptional. 

Service is mediocre. I think since our party was big, it was difficult for the waiters to see what's going on. They tried to refill our drinks but they weren't always on top of everything. They didn't ask us for refill for chips and salsa but we definitely kept requesting for much. I always like complimentary chips and salsa (how can you go wrong?!)

I had oral surgery yesterday and I went in to the store because there was 6 cars waiting for the drive-thru and this is the only pharmacy even close to my house.  After waiting in line 10 minutes just to drop off my prescription, the guy could notice I was in a great deal of pain and said he'd get my prescription filled within 15 minutes.  I decided to sit in the waiting area and suffer in silence.

First off, I can't believe the authorities allow them to sell medical supplies, treat patients (they have a little doctor's office in back) or fill prescriptions here.  This place is a disgusting mess.  There were 3 chairs available for me to sit in, one had garbage on it, one had what I can only describe as a ""snail trail"" on it and one was tucked in the corner under some advertisements and next to the busy staff door.  After wedging myself into the only ""clean"" chair I started the long painful wait at Walgreens.  Once I left the store, I wanted to take off all my clothes in the parking lot and burn them right there.  I had the worst case of the heebeegeebees and didn't want to take that filth home with me.  ewwwww!!!  

Now, I understand that they're busy and that other people too are in pain or need meds urgently.  I also understand that they have no control over the wackos that they let in the door and that they can't shut up that kid who is screaming and throwing a fit.  But they could at least, at very minimum, be somewhat accurate with how long they tell you it'll be.  I wouldn't have waited if they told me it was going to take 40 minutes.  I don't think I would've waited if they told me 20 minutes.  And from here on out, I won't wait at all, no matter my condition.

Made the mistake of taking the husband on a Friday night and we didn't even stay for a drink. Apparently this is THE place for the Chandler cougar crowd and the 40-50 somethings acting like bnoxious 20 year olds.

Definitely can't recommend on the weekend, and if you do attempt it, keep in mind that there is absolutely nothing else in the area as far as bars or nightlife so you may be stuck trekking it into Chandler or Tempe to find something else to do.

There is a place in Hawaii called Puka Dog. Maui Dog is like it's Arizona cousin. The taste was almost exactly the same. You pick what kind of dog you want, what kind of garlic mayo and your fruit relish. It sounds kinda gross but it's fantastic! The combo just works somehow.

I got a regular hot dog with mild garlic mayo and mango. So, so good. The mayo still had a bit of kick to it even though it was mild and the fruit relish was sweet and tasty. The perfect balance. The dog itself was huge and had a good beefy flavor. And the bun was nice and fresh which can really make or break a hot dog. They also serve tots and fries. Awesome!

I can't wait to get back and get another maui dog, this time with multiple fruits. I might even have to get a spam slider.

Restaurants lower their prices during this 7-day period (a three-course meal runs you $29 per person) in order to gain new customers and fill spots during less-popular dining times. At places like Lon's or Cowboy Ciao, guests end up getting meals that would normally cost $50 or more per person for a mere $29. Knowing that I got a much-more expensive meal at a bit of a discount definitely makes me want to give Lon's a higher rating. 

At the same time, however, my husband and I were discussing that we would have been disappointed with our experience *had we paid* twice the price. And since people reading this review may not have the good fortune of going to Lon's during the RW, when prices are lower than normal, I'm going to have to give the restaurant 3 stars. This is based on the food not being that flavorful or impressive given the prices they normally charge. 

We started the meal with Absolut martinis, which were pricey at $12 each and contained vermouth even though we asked for them ""dry."" Since we, just like Joel L, thought that spare ribs was a strange starter but both wanted to try them, we decided to pick a starter off the regular menu. We both love duck, so we ordered the salad with the seared duck. It wasn't great. We liked that it had pine nuts but found the dressing to be overwhelming acidic and were disappointed by the four pepperoni-shaped, paper-thin, and bland-tasting duck pieces. 

The disappointment continued with the spare ribs. I loved the sweet potato puree that accompanied them but found the ribs themselves to be a bit dry and not all that flavorful. The ""carrot jus"" was not detectable (or if it was, didn't add much), and we were dismayed to see that the listing for the same ribs on the regular menu said that the meat came with ""ancho chile chocolate sauce."" How sad that the RW version of the ribs didn't have the opportunity to be dressed up in a more flavorful sauce!

For my entree, I ordered the pan-roasted scallops with the roasted pepper spaetzle, organic spinach, and the corn jus. My husband doesn't care for scallops much, but I found them to be well-cooked and not too metallic or gritty (as bad scallops can be). The sides, especially the spaetzle, were interesting and pretty flavorful. I could definitely taste that the spinach was organic. I also had a glass of wine with my entree and did appreciate the pairings listed on the RW menu next to each course, which made it easy to quickly choose an appropriate wine.  

My husband had the open-faced shrimp ravioli. We both loved the concept and again, found the vegetables to be really fresh and tender. However, we didn't taste anything resembling lobster jus and found the shrimp to be pretty over-cooked. The portion was small, which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful, but that wasn't really the case here. 

In terms of desserts, the lemon tarte was just ok (and actually reminded me of those lemon bars you make from a boxed mix), but the chocolate truffle torte with the minted berries was outstanding. Since we weren't blown away by any of the other dishes we had tried, it was really nice to end the meal with a delicious, rich dessert. 

I am glad to have had a romantic meal in a beautiful patio setting for only $29 per person, but again, we would have been quite disappointed with Lon's food had we gone and paid regular prices for everything ($25+ for the shrimp ravioli would have been the most disappointing).  That being said, I can't reiterate how peaceful and unique the patio setting is, and the service was certainly professional and attentive (the bus boys did an especially nice job of keeping the table clean and re-filling water glasses). The atmosphere and service may make me want to go back at some point (maybe on someone else's dime!) and give Lon's food another try. 

One final note - Lon's does take reservations through OpenTable.com although the email confirmation requested that we call the restaurant directly in order to secure patio seating, so I would suggest making direct contact with the restaurant if it really matters to you to sit on the patio.",review,8,HOleI3jz1MLNUJ6cc1x0Pw

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.

I don't really know what else to say. You can sing the praises of any burger joint in town, but I haven't come across one that beats the flavor or the au poivre II - juicy beef, big enough for two, cracked peppercorns, thick cut bacon, wine sautéed onions plus blue cheese... it is a brilliant combination and has never disappointed, and I rarely even order a burger. 

If you would prefer to skip the beef the AZ88 chicken is doused in buffalo sauce served on a bun with blue cheese (everything should be served with blue cheese) and is a great choice. If you'd like to forgo the beef and the bun, the AZ88 salad offers the same spicy buffalo chicken breast on top of the already well devised Four Season's salad, which offers a nice mix of fresh ingredients beyond your basic lettuces and tomatoes. 

You can't review AZ88 without discussing the cocktails - well you could, but it would be a shame to overlook these tasty little concoctions. Actually, ""little"" isn't a word I would use to describe the adult beverages here. AZ88's martinis are legendary for their size. I've heard complaints about the cost of the drinks here, but you are getting a lot of bang for your buck in that martini glass. The liquid tests the laws of viscosity and your waiter's balance as it makes its way to your table. It is a real challenge to see if you can pick it up from the table in a smooth enough manner to keep all the liquid in the glass. My favorite stolen from AZ88 cocktail trick is to make cubes of frozen juices and cover them in vodka - no mixing required! This makes me look super slick when I have a party (shhh).

I just recently found out AZ88 is dog friendly on the patio, which just makes me love them all the more. I have a feeling my Italian greyhound will be a big fan of the burger and will also appreciate the fact that it's way too much for me to eat on my own.",review,3,mE2ll6yfwUvy-W7To3E0AQ

My good buddy suggested that we go to a new Italian joint that had opened around the corner. 

I felt slightly awkward going in wearing cut off shorts and a t-shirt as people were relatively nicely dresses, whats a guy going to do, i just drove five hrs and my money is green too. The hostess was a miserable human, scowling and not in the least bit friendly... now look, three guys in t-shirts and long hair, i get it, you think they are going to order water and three of the cheapest entrees but that doesn't mean you have to be obnoxious.  The restaurant itself has a romantic red tinted ambiance, typical white table cloths and a nice stone wall.  Each table is brought an assortment of french bread, focaccia, spicey peppers in oil, and herb butter.  The home made herb butter was actually one of the best things they served, it was the perfect blend of basil, garlic and s&p.

Wine-wise i got a bottle of the caldora sangiovese that was exceptional, a nice light fruity red.  We started out with the Zucchini fritte, the presentation was surprisingly original, the zuc was shaved into shoestrings and  lightly battered, served in a large bowl garnished with lemons. It was good but if i had my way the acidic nature of the fried veg would have been paired with a lemon aioli or anything stiffer than just lemon to cut through the heartiness of the battered zuc. As was everything at Aiello's the portion was more than the three of us could consume.

For our entrees we had the Oso Buco special, Gnocchi Pesto and a chicken ceas. The oso buco was good, it was served with TWO shanks, stewed veg and a bed of parpadelle.  I am a firm believer of quality over quantity, and while the meat was good it was by no means perfect. The outsides were fall off the bone tender but the further you got in the more tough it got, there is NO reason any human being needs to eat two veal shanks. Also, i prefer veal to be served over a creamy sage or spiced polenta as pasta can be heavy and flavorless (no sauce just the veg and veal jus) especially since it is hard to eat pasta with bites of meat. The gnocchi was good, the pesto was mild and they had tossed it with pine nuts, nothing revolutionary flavor-wise.  The ceas looked good, didn't try it, but it too was more than could be finished. 

During our entire service the the owner/head chef circled the dinning room haranguing guests and post-bill playing Italian ""pick a number"" for a free meal. Now during the meal he asked every table BUT the three guys in t-shirts with goofy hair how their food was, how their evening was going, etc. Look i get you think this is a classy place and what are these three punks doing in here but after an app, three entrees and a bottle you might think he would realize we're no ""water and bread shmucks."" No big deal, i had no pressing need to talk to him but apparently when the bill is presented it is mandatory to play his ""pick a number game"", every other table got a speech and epic fanfare but when it came to us we got a terse ""pick a number 'tween 1-100, get a free meal 'cept yah booze"" ... hahaha Alright, if you are going to turn your nose up at some guys in t-shirts then ditch the pick a number, it isn't charming and is definitely not classing up the joint.  Oh, also, since your kitchen is open onto the dining room, can you NOT stand in the dinning room yelling at cooks, it echos through the entire restaurant and is pretty awkward. 

If you have ever watched the Sopranos there is a series of shows where Vesuvios (Artie Bucco's restaurant where the family oft gathers) is doing poorly and Tony suggest it is because Artie is an over anxious, fawning host who interjects himself into everyone's conversations while hanging over guests whilst they eat. This should be no owner/chef/manager's model and while Aiello's owner is not THAT extreme he seems to be heading down the same road.  People come to eat, enjoy each other's company and relax.. try something a little more subtle like a digestif compliments of the chef or a handshake and inquiry about the food when delivering the bill.

Came across Jamburritos at the Phoenix Public Farmers' Market on a Saturday morning. Now with all those food options around (Hey Joe, Short Leash, etc.) you may ask what made me pick this one (besides the heat); Catfish! I hadn't had catfish (scratch that, good catfish) in quite sometime. 

I had a couple options for the catfish; grilled or fried/sandwich or bowl. Over a couple of visits, I have all the combinations. There is no wrong way to have Chef Michael Brown's catfish. 

The catfish was perfect, and what I mean by that is: 
- Perfectly cooked, tender and flaky 
- spiced perfectly (wife finds it a little hot for her, but still tastes so good she is willing to endure) :) 

If they don't have the catfish, I usually go for a chicken jamburrito with rice, andouille sausage, pepper jack cheese, and lettuce. The make a great red/hot sauce you can put on any of the menu and kick the heat up a notch. 

Lastly, can't forget to mention the hushpuppies. I consider myself a foodie, but I eat these little deep-fried puffs so fast that I don't take anytime to figure out what is in them. I know for sure though, they are NOT like any hushpuppies you have had before (oh so good).

Barro's pizza is second to none. At least for me that is. It isn't my wife's favorite but she knows I like it so much that she takes one for the team for my sake. All of the pizzas I have had from pepperoni to the works type are very good. Fresh, good ingredients, a little more sauce than other pizza joints make for an awesome pie. Please don't go here and buy a salad. That would completely negate the awesome which is waiting to be made for you.

The other options are also rather good as well. The wings are not my favorite but they are still very good. They are bigger than most wings in the area and the sauce is thicker and stickier than comparable wings as well. They aren't the style I usually prefer but they are big and meaty nonetheless. The flavor is good and the heat is predictable depending on the grade you select. The salad bar always has fresh ingredients if that is your persuasion. I have had one before and they have some good dressings as well. Thankfully, my wife really likes to eat the salad while I devour the pizza she doesn't care for very much.

Boston Market on a Friday night, thought I'd stop by for some quick comfort food before heading to the movies. It was not busy but they way they handled everything you would have thought it was packed. 

They must have some new employee issues because I got one taking my order. I ordered a carver sandwich. My child ordered mac and cheese of course. It seemed to be a language barrier when I said Brisket carver sandwich on WHEAT. She repeated back to me three times insisting I do the combo. Ok maybe it only comes as a combo so I say yes.

Some sort of holdup and they say they will bring to it to the table for us.  We get our Mac N Cheese and drinks and sit. A few minutes later the 1/2 carver arrived wrapped and ready togo.  No au jus for dipping. No salad. Just a 1/2 sandwich. She says ""I'm sorry"" and realizes she forgot the rest of the order and quickly goes back to get the missing food. The manager comes by and asks what is wrong as he is apologizing to every table. He was the manager of ""I'm sorry"". She comes back with the food and leaves.

Constructed in 1976 with good intentions, the 2.5 acre park was never a success. A charming amphitheatre looks like it would be perfect for a small jazz concert or other musical event, but to date I have never heard of a single concert playing here. Despite its location in the heart of our city's financial district, no downtown professionals I know ever spend any time there except to scurry past the bums, who've taken it over, to the elevators, which take them to the underground parking structure for the nearby courts and other buildings. It is, or was, to be avoided both day and night. The homeless have always run the place. Although the city cleaned and maintained it regularly, it still smelled like pee. If you dared to walk through it at night, you'd see cockroaches running before every step you took. It was nasty. 

When the plan to demolish it for the new Cityscape project was proposed, some community activists put up a major fuss in protest. I don't know why and I don't care. I live in downtown Phoenix. I have taken 100% of my assets and hard-earned savings and invested them in this area. I'm here for the long haul, and I used my vote and my voice to support the new plans. 

Patriots Park is no longer fully accessible, as it has been fenced off for future demolition.  Many people who grew up in Phoenix have nostalgic feelings about the place, because in its heyday I'm sure it was a much different experience. But it simply hasn't worked out in the long run. In keeping with the constant theme that is a part of our fine city, it is time to reinvent and move on.",review,5,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw

Sure, there are a few things I would change if I could, but I cannot give this place less than five stars. 

Right when you walk into the Saguaro, the colors and design work will blow you away. I checked in on Saturday and got here way earlier than the normal check-in time, but when I got to the front desk I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it wasn't a problem! The girl working at the desk was so nice and asked me to wait about ten minutes and she'd have a room for me. She followed through on her word, and a few minutes later I had a bottle of water in hand from the valet guys and was making my way to my room. Since I was recovering from a cold and had a long morning of travel, I was so happy to be so close to a bed.

I was totally blown away by my room. It's absolutely huge and beautiful, and the bright colors & cool designs pop. The king size bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, and the balcony is nice when I want to get a bit of fresh air. The bathroom leaves a bit to be desired, but you can't have it all I suppose. The robes are unbelievably comfortable, and the true comfort of this room is so appreciated. Also, there's a Kuerig in here with a variety of K-Cups. Yes please.

The room service menu from Distrito is ridiculous. When I got here, I ordered guac, chicken tacos, and a plantain app, and everything was so flavorful and well-made. The breakfast is pretty good, too. Employees are more than friendly and do what they can to make you happy & comfortable.

I have only two small complaints... well, more just things to be aware of. The hotel was having some sort of pool party on Saturday from 12-6, and it sounded like an episode of Jersey Shore was being filmed right. outside. my window. The music was so loud I could feel the bass vibrating my bed, and had to listen to lots of ""whoooooo!"" and also some bro talk. I was so glad when that damn thing ended. This hotel markets itself as a social place, though, so you already know what you're getting yourself into. Also, on Saturday night around 9pm, two young men in staff shirts came by and knocked on my door to do some housekeeping. What? Why are you coming to my door on a Saturday night to fix up my room? I called the front desk to make sure that was normal (and yknow, they weren't some crazy dudes from next door) and the front desk assured me they were just being thorough. 

The pool is pretty cool, though, and impressive. Think Vegas style. I don't know how appealing the furniture is because it's a little dirty and stained up, but I could see myself laying in the sun for a few hours at some point this week. The workout room is also a good size with tons of equipment!

Five stars, especially for having a restaurant as cool and beautiful as Distrito attached. Glad to be living in luxury for the next four days!",review,6,NduGDKc6hLcb1S6OtW62XQ

When the employee went to the clean the door and windows, he sprayed the Windex like crazy and the fan totally blew it all over my table.

In less than a minute I had my new sub, which I will actually have for breakfast in the morning. 

I understand that everyone makes mistakes and that often at fast food joints it is an employee's first job, so I usually expect the management to make right any of the blunders, without the customer having to raise a fuss.

I've been here on Sundays for the ""Pig Out"" all you can eat pork event which is great.

This recent visit they were offering a five course fixed menu with wine pairings for $65/person.  I love these type events because the chef can experiment with new recipes and as a guest I get to try many new flavors and wines.

This meal progressed from scallops to roasted guinea hen to halibut to Berkshire pork to chocolate cake.  My favorite was the pork and least favorite course was the chocolate cake with the lime sorbet.

The wines were mostly from Spain with a Malbec and Champagne added to round out the pairings.

Sat in the bar for a glass of wine before dinner. I asked bartender to open something fresh. He was more than happy to comply. The bottle was still at room temperature, which in Phoenix generally means too warm. Places of this caliber should serve red wines at the right temp!

Capital Grille, like a lot of high-end steak houses in the Phoenix area, seem to have run off their highly experienced ""professional"" wait staff over the past couple of years. I'm sure this saves the business a few dollars in overhead, but I miss the ambiance created by highly trained waiters. Nevertheless, our server was anxious to please. (The ""busboy"" was clueless.)

This night I had the asparagus wrapped in prosciutto....while good, the asparagus were a bit too large and therefore not very tasty....it was served with a little olive oil and balsamic, so not too interesting.

I chose a Diavalo pizza with fresh garlic added.  The crust was good, the sauce was minimal(coulda used a little more), a little too light on the cheese, and it had pepperoni and fresh jalapenos....good taste but just seemed to be missing something?!  

The service was cordial, but not overly friendly and it seemed like the folks were unhappy that we came in late(8pm).

The perfect economically savvy choice to start your evening whether you are hitting the town hard or simply plan on wetting your whistle with one drink. 

I want to make special note of the entertainment provided by the live band that plays every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night from 8pm-11pm.

You also don't feel overwhelmed by the music due to the open air facility and conversation is actually possible, unlike many other live band bars.

But, I didn't notice a lot of variety.  It was mostly a handful of brands with several boxes of a specific item.  They have tons of pipes + pipe tobacco, several humidors to pick from, lighters, knives, etc.  There is smoking in the store (except the humidor) which can be a bit of a turn off to those that only like to intake smoke when they are smoking (I'm like this).  The only place to linger if you aren't smoking is the humidor anyway right?  

It was so large I completely forget I showed up near close.  They were never pushy and came to ask if we needed anything a few times.  I didn't realize until we left.  I am never that guy, and felt bad for it.  We grabbed a few cigars and hit the road.

The prices are quite high.  I bought some Sancho Panza's at 40% off and they were still more expensive than a larger cigar (same line) in the humidor at Total Wine.  With it being further from my house than 5-10 other cigar shops and that I typically avoid the 'Tuke because of the resident's being in denial about actually living in Phoenix...  I will stick closer to home.  The other reason is I avoid places with employees that pack heat.  Too much overcompensation screws up my chi.

I'm going to give four stars for gemütlichkeit (coziness), since I had a great time hanging out in the bar listening to accordion music coming from a table full of regulars. The bartender was also personable and conversational, so I stuck around after my first beer in order to quaff a second and order some grub off of the bar menu.

I was intrigued by the bratwurst sliders. I'm pretty tuned in to what decent bratwurst should taste like, since I lived in Germany for nearly three years. I'm partial to the Thüringer style, which is what I came across growing up in West Berlin, but everyone in the Phoenix area appears to favor the Nürnburger variety. The Nürnburger style is perfectly acceptable to me however, as I had eaten a delicious one on the street at the Mesa Christkindlmarkt (Christmas market) just a few days earlier.

Let me offer my comments about where Black Forest Mill got it wrong. The bratwurst sliders were served with sauerkraut which was just too darn sour. I glanced at some fellow bar diners who left their sauerkraut nearly untouched. They really need to cut back on the brininess (rinse it better before preparing or add some apples to balance it out). I don't think this is an ""American palette"" issue... it really is nearly inedible. Now the bratwurst ""slider"" is a novel idea I applaud. But they were served on sweet dinner rolls which were soft (almost like Hawaiian bread). Not only did they get soggy sitting in some sauerkraut juice drifting over from the other side of the plate, but it was the wrong flavor and texture counterpoint to the sausage. A sturdier more rustic European-type brötchen is what I was hoping for. And the bratwurst themselves were unremarkable. Tasted boiled... should've been grilled. The mustard that came with them was the standard American substitute for German mustard, Gulden's spicy brown mustard, which isn't bad. However, I had just shopped next door at the German Sausage Company (presumably the same owners?) and noticed they had authentic sharp German Löwensenf. I think it would've been a real treat if this restaurant could've offered some of that on the side instead.

So, call me picky if you must. But I think I know German food and, although I loved the atmosphere and the beer, I think the Black Forest Mill could step it up a bit on the food preparation. I will post an update if I return and try something here that hits the mark. The waiter kept talking up the schnitzel sampler, and the gulasch and spätzle sound awfully tempting. But again, it might just be that you have to be careful what you order.",review,0,0Ke0iSAPYi8hUVxLocAlYQ

A whimsical foodie could easily go broke here. I watch their ads and generally only buy things on sale or occasional indulgences (read: weekly sugar cookie trip). Surprisingly here, some things are no more expensive than other grocery stores (gallons of water, certain condiments, Peanut M&Ms, off the top of my head), but a lot of specialty items and most of the produce are nooooot cheap. Just the act of shopping here makes me giddy- there's nice lighting and soooo much beautiful food all around. 

My absolute favorite thing here is the bakery- it's top notch. Depending on how early in the day you go, there may or may not be a lot of things to choose from. I love the sugar cookie and also the red velvet cupcake. You can't go wrong with the cheesecakes, and the tartufo we found during the holidays was the richest food i've ever eaten (chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse layered with chocolate cake, covered in chocolate). Their coffee drinks are also pretty good although I have to ask for a bit less sugar. 

The prepared food bars are also delicious- they serve a dinner every night that promises a good meal but at a cost of $12-16 a plate. The salad bar is good for lunch. I haven't yet tried the sandwich/pizza bar, but it smells good when i'm there. The sushi bar also has happy hour specials in the afternoons. 

Going on around the store, there is an extensive meat and seafood counter. The butchers are knowledgeable about what they sell and are happy to cut/wrap things differently for you. Recently there was a sale on Kobe beef and I came in at least 3 times that week! Everything always looks and smells very fresh.

Ok, I feel like i've covered the highlights. Beyond this, if you're after something very specific/hard to find, this store will be the one to have it if anyone does.

This spa is very small and a strange setup.   It almost seems as the ""spa"" was an afterthought for the hotel and is quickly outgrowing the space they have allotted for it. 

You check in and then go to your womens/mens locker room to change into your robe and then come back out to the check-in area in your robe (which is also where people are getting manicures/pedicures) - so far- not relaxing..  They then usher you out the door and across the hall (which is a hallway filled with hotel rooms).  Across the hall is your ""relaxation room""  aka a hotel room with the bed removed and some chairs, magazines and some fancy water with pineapple, oranges and cucumber floating in it. 

When its your turn , they come into the room grab you and bring you back across the hall to your treatment room which is back where the locker rooms are.  The actual treatment room they put me in had a wall divider used so I could sometimes hear the people in the next room.  

Overall, the masseuse was really good, but the atmosphere its self wasn't that calm and relaxing.

Not only is the money spent here kept in the state, it's kept in the neighborhood (the owners live only blocks away in the heart of CenPho). The entire place is self constructed of the blood, sweat, and tears of the owners (a Husband and Wife team), and they have great design sense.

As for the class, here's the deal ... I know nothing about Yoga, and this was my first Yoga class. It kicked my slacker ass, but I felt all the better for it. The cute as hell instructor could not have been a nicer person (I'm seeing a pattern here). She instructed the class in a relaxing yet deliberate and concise manner.

Just a top notch business all around. Did I mention that the owners were out of the world nice, cool and down to earth people? Well it can't be said enough ...

COFFEE:  We had a chai latte and a banana nut mocha.  Additionally, we had a chocolate muffin which was quite good!  Both were very good and foamy!   

PARKING:  We were fortunate to find a spot in front of Sola.  However, it looks like patrons most often need to park along the streets in Olde Town.  

PERKS:  Options for brewing and free wireless internet!

SERVICE:  You can tell that the business was designed by a true coffee connoisseur as we had four options for brewing.  The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly.

Our first impression was good... Adorable ambiance, delicious looking case of gelato, large inviting patio.  We were greeted by a sloppy surly man, who we later found out is the owner Andy. 
We were seated on the patio along with the only other customer.  We started off by ordering a bottle of sparking water. ""You guys don't want any wine?!"" said Andy abruptly. Uh no thanks.  Next we ordered dinner.  My sister is vegetarian, so we were ordering meatless options this evening.  We ordered a selection of bland, boring, typical food. For some reason Andy seemed confused that we wanted to share a few items.  The food came... Andy dropped it and ran off.  We were sharing so we wanted plates. We waited for a long time. No Andy.  I went into the restaurant to ask for plates and some salt&pepper. Andy seemed confused. ""why do you need plates? I don't get it. You eatin it like Chinese food or something?!?"" He brought the plates and the salt & pepper and said ""You know you really shouldn't put anything on it until you taste it."" Thanks for the words of wisdom.  
We ate our depressing display of  cuisine in hopes that dessert would help this disaster. We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more( Andy was busy sitting at the other customer's table talking all night).  By the time he finally got around to clear our plates we were so ready to get the heck outta there we decided to skip dessert. 

NEXT CAME THE ICING ON THE POORLY MADE CAKE:
I decided to tell Andy how I felt about the poor service.  As a person in the customer service industry, I know I would appreciate the polite constructive criticism.  He was apparently OUTRAGED by the comments. He proceeded to argue with us about every comment we had.  He even went so far as to walk into the restaurant to yell to his co-workers about my apparently salacious comments.  He told me the balance of our Groupon tab was on him. I left cash on the table for it anyway.  He then chased us into the parking lot to try and give the money back.  When I refused he yelled ""I don't want this I will donate it to charity!!!""

Dessert was 9.00 and was comped because it was my birthday.  9.00 for bread puding( stale bread that is pure profit) is pricey.  My uncle had another appetizer, a calamari salad.

To begin, I like any of the shrimp -- whether it be the Barbecued Shrimp or Shrimp Cocktail. For the entrée, I recommend a Filet or a T-Bone; the latter, if you have a big appetite.

Appetizer prices range from about $13 to $16. Steaks range from about $35 to $45. However, there is a Porterhouse that is to feed two people. The Porterhouse for two is upwards of about $80.

My main problem with Ruth's Chris Steak House is that they seem to butter the steak excessively. Moreover, the prices are a bit inflated for what you get -- which is expected.

The patio had so much potential, however having no lighting I was not the only one struggling to see the menu.

Drinks: The extremely watered down sangria that tasted like white grape juice with A SINGLE canned peach slice stuck to the bottom. Just nasty. Even the water smelled like mildew and I didn't dare touch the dried out lemons.

Appetizer: My fiance ordered the Fiaggi Misti (meat and cheese assortment, supposedly) It consisted of Oscar Meyer look a like garlic bologna, even worse ""sopressatta"" that looked like a hunk of fat, and two choices of tiny pieces of dried out cheeses. Oh yes, let us not forget the store bought bread sticks brought out in their packaging still, on top of the assortment still in the damn wrappers, stuck between 3 kalamata olives. What the hell do I do with all the wrappers now? Beyond disgusting. Worst part is that they charge $15 for the damn thing!! 

Dinner: Now I enjoy my pizza well done. I just do. Don't ask, just make it happen, ok??! The Toscana pizza that we ordered, was neither well done, and had Wal-Mart quality ingredients. Terrible mozzarella, soggy whole mushrooms, and bland sausage with zero fennel, whatsoever. The sauce was more of a bland paste than a sauce.

The crowd was incredibly senior-- I felt like quite the spring chicken being the youngest at 31 years of age (which I must admit I didn't mind seeing as last time I went out in Scottsdale it was filled with 21-year olds all of whom seemed to already be botox-laden).
The food:
Curly Endive Salad with Mustard Dressing, Bacon, and Poached Egg- the deep, tangy, creamy Dijon dressing was perfect over the crunchy endive.  Add to that fatty, crispy bacon and a perfectly poached egg and you've got a near-perfect salad.
The homemade lobster bisque (SOD) was exquisite.  Silky and creamy, loads of lobster flavor and just hints of butter in the background.
Salmon Quesadilla- it actually wasn't much of an actual quesadilla but more like a flatbread, and it was my absolute favorite.  It's the classic pairing- dill, horseradish cream, etc, and very well-executed.
Four Cheese Ravioli- they made this usual ho-hum dish sparkle with a light tomato basil sauce and sharp, delicious cheeses.
Other guests in our party had the lamb shank and the filet mignon special, each of which were devoured with praise.

The service was great and the manager even got us a seat way before the quoted 30 minute wait.  

I had the short-rib enchiladas and highly enjoyed them.  They tasted a lot like the enchiladas my ex's mom used to make.  So, it's nice that I no longer have to date him just for his mother's delicious Mexican meals.  The rice is also pretty good, but a little different- it's creamy and corn adds a hint of sweetness that I really enjoy, even though it can be a bit salty for my taste.

I enjoyed the Coconut Shrimp ($6), which came with a delicious slaw-like side.  The shrimp had a wonderful blend of seafood and coconut, not too sweet and definitely crunchy!  I also order the Fried Macaroni and Cheese ($5), which came as two very large wedges and a sweet & spicy dipping sauce.  They were nice and crispy on the outside, and deliciously cheesy on the inside.  I would definitely recommend dipping bites into the sauce! My only complaint would have to be that one or two bites, deep on the inside, were a little cold.  It could certainly have been a one-time thing, and I have to admit that I'd probably try it again.

Everything else I sampled from my fellow teachers was also pretty tasty, including the shrimp ceviche and apple-glazed meatballs.  While we're only a team of 6 teachers, the seating was set for groups of 4, so we had to just turn our chairs and chat.  Not ideal, but we managed.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

They were open...so that was a good start.  I'm a sucker for good German food (but quick to be annoyed by German slop claiming to be good food).  

The Goodness:  They were open on Memorial Day, that's a good start.  $5.50 0.5liter beers is another good starting point (I got a tasty hefeweizen myself).  We both had one of their off menu specials, the Lamb Loin.  It came out green beans that were mixed up and cooked with bacon and fried up and potatoes that appear to have been fried up in Parmesan cheese or something.  They were all sitting in this tasty dark liquidy gravy next to this perfectly cooked and seasoned lamb loin. The lamb loin did require a knife to cut it up...but it was still very tender.  Tender and tasty.  I can't quite describe what it tasted like.  It is kind of like a good roast, but better.  

The Meh/Bad:  While the barkeep/waitress was nice enough....we were pretty much the only people sitting at the bar.  Having to wait about 10 minutes before seeing anyone was kind of blah.  Add to that when my friend asks the lady if they have any ""lunch specials"" she rattles off their list of ""specialties"" (off-menu ""specialties"").  We were unaware that we had this much of a misunderstanding...until the bill came...then we were keenly aware.  Not sure anything ""on-menu"" was that expensive.  It cost each of us $30 for the meal and a beer ($5.50 for a half liter of good German beer is pretty good though).

Whenever anyone is visiting from out of town we go to Houston's for a nice casual dinner. 

We were a little sad when they told us they were closing, but excited that they were building a brand new building just down the road. 

Last night the Hubs, mother in law and I decided to hit up Houston's. We pulled up to the valet and no one was there, we look and Houston's is gone. Then we looked and noticed the Hillstone sign was lit. 

The hubs and MIL didn't believe me that Hillstone and Houston's were the same company. But they are! Woot! 

The new building is AMAZING! I loved the patio, though they will only serve apps and drinks out there, they wont let you have dinner out there which is to bad considering last night was perfect out door dinning weather. 

The new building has that same Houston's vibe, only its way bigger! It now features two bars AND a sushi bar! 

The food is still the same and still just as amazing as it always is! 

One note of complaint however. The old Houston's used to offer a Riesling by the glass, now its only by the bottle, which is a total bummer because that's all my MIL will drink. 

We really had a great experience as we always do with this company.",review,2,6ts41fCsDKHbFZaKOMNmVQ

I had a college professor years ago that used to swear by it.  It always interested me, so when I received a coupon in the local mailer, a friend and I decided to give it a go.  I'm a naturally athletic person, but yoga had never been anything I had dabbled in.  The coupon was $10 for 10 days of unlimited yoga.  

The deal with Bikram yoga is the routine is the same every time.  There are 26 postures that are repeated in the same order each session and lasts 90 minutes.  The room is about 105 degrees and 40% humidity.  You sweat like a pig, but don't wipe it off b/c it will help cool you down - that's my little knowledge gift to you.

Shelby and John Rayner are the owners and teach many of the classes.  They used to teach them all, but I think they have hired some additional instructors.  The decor and ambiance is very calming and it's a very positive place.  The instructors try to learn your name as quickly as possible and make you feel welcome.  I'm not going to lie, Bikram yoga is tough as nails, but I found it very satisfying.  I had to take it down one star on the vote just because it is so damn expensive.  I haven't been since I completed my 10 day trial, but hopefully I'll be able to pick it up when I have some more walkin' around money.

If you're looking for something new, check out Bikram Yoga Avondale and let the Rayners take care of you.  Also browse their website b/c it's really informational.  They've gotten so busy in the last few months they have added additional class times and online sign-ups (there were no sign-ups when I went).  Also, they have a better maiden voyage deal for the newbies - $40 for one month unlimited.  It was hard to orchestrate it all within 10 days - one month is much more generous so take advantage and give it a whirl!

P.S.  The small, tight fitting clothing isn't just so people can flaunt what they've got.  It really helps you do the postures more effectively.  Plus, if you wear sweats or any sort of bulky clothing, you'll feel like you want to die.  So, the moral of the story is to man up and go with the flow.  The patrons are great and no one cares what other folks are wearing.  Actually, you might stick out if you're sportin' the sweatsuit so get skimpy to blend in.",review,3,#NAME?

The old vietnamese restaurant that stood in the same place was typical and nothing to write home about. When I saw the new place pop up a couple years ago, I was intrigued but never thought to go there, being that there are at least 2 restaurants in that same plaza that I would much rather go to. But I had the urge to try it with a friend and I came out unimpressed. There are about 5-7 Vietnamese places within a 10 mile radius of this place and I find it strange that their prices are higher than all the rest. Their soup in pho wasnt especially good, though it was passable. Their rice dishes seemed to be on par with others but for the price you would expect more. The only redeeming thing about this place would be the more contemporary decor that you don't see in most other Vietnamese places. It was cleaner and from the table setup you could tell they are aiming for a higher echelon of clientele.  

The bottom line: The food was ok. The ambience was better than most. If you care about such things then this may be the place for you. As for me, I'd rather save a couple bucks, endure a nondescript dining area and go to one of the many places just minutes away.",review,3,N98mJQDzTjzT216SFVeBDQ

Unfortunately, there was no free parking available, so I paid for parking across the street at the ASU lot.

After walking up to order a bacon burger and fries, we got lunch served on a paper plate, like you would at a family BBQ or picnic grill. Seriously, it's no frills. Then, you head over to the condiment bar to get your own lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, onion, etc. Just like if you were at a family BBQ. Noticing a trend?  Now, find a place to sit, but warning, it might be sticky!

On to the food: the burger was juicy, and had good flavor, but the bun was TERRIBLE. Grocery-store-white-bread-soggy-in-10-seconds, wait, the kind that you get at a family BBQ, bun.  Toppings were acceptable, not exceptional.  Fries were decent.  You gotta eat pretty fast before the sandwich falls apart.

The soups are either blah or fantastic though.  There is no middle ground here, so if you are a big soup fan be warned that it is hit or miss.

Thursday evening right before a baseball game, there were people drinking and eating outside and insude. The places was pretty busy. 

How bad could it be?

UGGHH.... The server was wearing last years skinny shorts and was muffin topping out of them all over the place. She never refilled water, only came back after motioning to her, recommended shit food. 

I am a burger snob, so I ask before I order if the burgers are:

1. Good
2. Fresh not frozen
3. Can be cooked to med rare

Answers were:

1. Yes, they are excellent
2. Yes, hand pattied and fresh
3. Yes, but only to Meduim

So I get the burgers and frys. The frys were good. (got that out of the way)

Problems with the burger:

1. Worst burger i have ever had
2. fresh yesterday because it was a premade and cooked then placed in a juice of somesort, re-grilled on a flat op and burnt on one side only. It had zero flavor and was 1/2 mushy, 1/2 burnt.
3. was cooked all the way through like a freakin meatloaf

It was so bad i added salt 3 times and pepper 2 times. I still needed something to taste so i added the chili peppers from the pizza. 

Needless to say they took it off the bill. 

The other items we had was a Philly and there was about 1/2 the meat it should have. Pizza slice, was day old and rubbery. 

The drinks were served in cheap plastic cups like you get at a ""free drink "" special night in a nasty strip club or something. They were waek as shit too. 

Blah.....

One really cool feature of this library is the children's section on the first floor.  Walk past the reflection pool, heading south and you'll find an extensive children's section.  It served as a perfect and *free* place for our small party of toddlers to kill some time.  There is a low, curved bench with cubbies full of books which piqued our girl's interest.  The bench seat had various art embedded into it, providing it texture.  Another great part of the kid's section is the large, dark blue felt feature on the wall.  Several small, bright & colorful pieces of felt in the shape of familiar cats & fish and the unfamiliar coyotes can be be placed at will.  This is an idea I'll definitely steal! 

There is an adjoining courtyard next to that section.  It is enclosed with a curving tall fence, part of which is made with colorful sections of purple, blue, red, etc.  We weren't able to access it because they closed it due to mud.

Let me break it down for you. I love IKEA, I think they have a lot of great items, and are priced nicely. I also dig Scandinavian style, and profess a minimalist attitude towards all things.  So I get it, IKEA is cool for the most part, and I have a lot of stuff from this mega-store. What I don't like about IKEA is their physical store setup. I hate being forced into the ""showroom"" I don't want to walk Odin's path, or travel the way of the great Vikings Consumers of the past. I just want a curtain rod, and a curtain. THAT IS IT.  After fighting my way through the hordes of people and peasants alike, I fought my way through to the ""marketplace"" 

checklist out....(written in blood on a dried deer skin.)

1. curtain rod.
2. curtain rod attachments for the wall
3. oh.... don't forget the curtain

As I make my way past screaming kids, couples arguing over a Faux-Painting, and through the warehouse full of prefabricated, assemble required, plan about 4 hours on a Saturday to complete, furniture.I go to self checkout...Yes I am Free!! (1.5 hours later)

I did it!!!!!  I have my curtain I need. I will ""install"" this now as ""hang"" sounds gay. So I  install my curtain I realize, ""wow this helps to reduce the sun's infiltration into my soul, and think my other room would benefit from a curtain as well.  This means (insert Darth Vader March music here) another trip to IKEA....

This time however, I have a plan. I will go through the checkout area, through the warehouse, and totally bypass the showroom. Fuck IKEA, I am not a lemming easily led through a retail smorgasbord. Even if they had aquavit and salmon gravlax waiting for me, I'd still go through the Swedish ""backdoor"" 

I make my way in and repeat  the above 3 steps and I am out in 20 minutes. I have to say this must be some sort of world record. 

All in all, you can defeat IKEA, you just need to be sneaky and quick, you have to focus, and avoid any contact with people once in the store. Upon arriving home, I go to ""install"" this other curtain, and to really man-ify the situation, and to de-gay the whole weekend experience of shopping for ""window trimmings"" I put the Redsox   game on, (they won in 13 innings) and make it as ""tough"" of experience as installing a curtain can be.

Thanks Ashley for making it a painful and stressful process. 

I originally reviewed Yelp! and several of the typical AZ chain stores websites (Room Store, Mor, Ashley, etc.) Ashley seemed to have the best options (but no pricing) so I went there first. Ugh. Big mistake. 

First off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door. You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture. (Um, yeah, thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes with...I need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do, hopefully undistributed...) It's WORSE than buying a car. It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furniture...

I did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive. Like, overpriced expensive. I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there. However, at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements. 

I ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was ""the one"" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople).

Oh, and they don't include measurements on the item tag...I think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements, talking the ENTIRE time

Bottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy, but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around. The furniture stores I visited after Ashley (Razmataz, Mor, random other stores, had NORMAL sales people who asked you once if you needed help and then left you alone).",review,2,cSAACR699NuLMqBPuKL8nw

If you come from, say, Chattanooga, TN, or anywhere equally as appalling such as anywhere in-between Philly and Los Angeles, this city will probably be a step up for you.

PROS:
----------
Friendly people.  Beautiful sunsets.  Beautiful desert scenery.  Cheap rent.  Beautiful weather 6mos out of the year.  Pretty decent Magic the Gathering scene.  Wonderful family.  

CONS:
-----------
A big percentage of people here are radical Christians and loony Mormons waiting for their spaceship to the planet Kolob (look it up).

There are a lot of chain restaurants and you've really got to search high and low for decent eats.  Unfortunately, most Phonecians enjoy Applebees over, say, a great Cajun eatery. 

The music scene is laughable, at best.  When the weekend's headline event is ""Hardcore is a Girl's Best Friend"", and when you go to a desert party with 2 stages of Hardcore, you know you're in trouble.  The city's DnB weekly draws crowds in the single-digits, and most events, sound-wise, are utter failures.  For instance, bringing out a huge UK DnB DJ then having the sound cutting out and clipping all night, awesome!  Want to hear Glitch?  bawahaha, good luck.  How about DubStep?  woooo!  If you're lucky you can catch the DubStep _monthly_... yes folks, 1x's a month.  Awesome.  There is literally only one weekly that's worth anything and it's the Pound which has been going strong for 1yr.  Sadly, you see the same 100 people at every event worth anything.  So in a city of 5million or whatever, 100 people know and support good music.  *sigh*  Want to hear a sick DJ like DJ Dan, Donald Gladue, DJ Icey, etc....?  Well you have 1 option:  wade through the sea of douchebaggery at Myst filled with the worst of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale wanna-be's with their $200 jeans and $150 bling t-shirts with no clue that a world-class DJ is on the decks.... THEN, you will be sadly disappointed as you watch your favorite DJ spin a watered-down set on a shitty sound system.  Sweet.

Art?  ""Hellz yeah we have First Friday"".  Yeah, 1x's a month, there's something artsy to do.  Tits.

Public transportation?  Yeah, the people of The Valley voted for the Light Rail project... a BILLION dollar debacle which provides Phonecians a single route from Mesa up to Phoenix, at a cost of $2.50 for a r/t.  Is it cheaper than driving?  No.  Faster than driving?  Nah.  More convenient?  Nope.  Does it go anywhere useful?  Naw.  It serves only a tiny fraction of our population, mainly those that find it ""hip"" to live in Downtown Phoenix.  How about the bus?  Don't know, I've never seen a bus in Gilbert.

Weather?  Miserable... you are forced to live in an artificial environment 6months out of the year because it's too hot to have a window open, too hot to even go outside.  Sure there's a lot of nice outdoors activities, but you can only participate 1/2 the year.   Don't let people fool you and tell you ""it's a dry heat"".  I don't care if it's dry or not, 117 degrees is 117 degrees.  OH, and don't expect it to cool down at night.... 100 degrees at MIDNIGHT is actually common.  And btw, it's not always a ""dry heat""... most of the summer is Monsoon season.  You actually begin to look forward to the monsoons.

How does Phoenix's weather effect your body?  Well, if you enjoy not being able to breathe, sneezing, watery eyes, bloody noses, burning your flesh on your leather seats, Valley Fever, and respiratory issues, Phoenix is the place for you!

Job market?  Awesome, if you enjoy working for a call center.

Cops?  Super!  We've got the anti-Constitution, racial profiling, show-boating, murdering Joe Arpaio.  If you are caught with even a roach or a stem of weed, you're looking at a trip to Tent City where you can enjoy our 117 degree weather from the comfort of an outside bunk bed under a canvas tent.  If you're brown and working hard to support your family, expect for your place of business to be raided, and for you to be arrested and detained, probably even deported.

Drivers?  The drivers in Phoenix are fascinating to watch and observe.  They paint the perfect picture of mental retardation.  Everyone tailgates here, going 70mph.  I defy anyone to drive 20miles on our freeway systems and not see a rear-end accident.  Multiple rear-end accidents happen daily.  Why?  Because people drive at 70mph literally inches from the car in front of them.  Now any person with an IQ over 70 would be able to understand that if the car in front of them has to stop suddenly, you are guaranteed to get into an accident.  GUARANTEED.  I am baffled and literally astounded at the fact that no one seems to understand that out here.",review,16,waD2euOMPTnTzQ0thq3H6Q

I personally couldn't care less because the deals are absolutely AMAZING. My hands can afford a cleansing after they just saved hundreds of dollars. Where else can you find a Marc Jacobs purse for $200? I can't count how many bags and shoes I've purchased from Last Chance. Most of their shoes and bags need a little TLC (sometimes A LOT) whether that be a leather cleaning, repaired strap, or a fixed zipper.

Very new and modern and all we had to do was walk across the street to the whole Westgate Center/bars/restaurants/arena which was a HUGE plus!  At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back (a 5 minute walk) to our hotel safely! 

We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having ""bed bugs"" and being dirty.  You won't have that problem staying here!  The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating!  That was probably the best part:  Friendly staff!  The staff literally gave off a small town feel, the only time I've ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast!  And  the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it.  After drinking all night and being hung over, all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs, sausage, ham, toast, bagels, waffles, apple and orange juice and we were re-fueled up for some more debauchery!

This is a great little spot tucked away unsuspectingly on Camelback road. They have a great happy hour, pool tables and a surprisingly great menu. I haven't been here in awhile because of the economy the way that it is. But they did have off track betting as well . Not sure if they still do. 
The service is good the people are fun and friendly. I like bar food but you can get so much more here. 

Some of my Fav's 
The herb crusted beef tenderloin is outstanding great cut of meat cooked to perfection. 
The Mediterranean stuffed chicken stuffed with artichokes, black olives and feta with a dill sauce and wild rice it is delish! 
I am not a big fan of Pesto but their Penne pesto cream is yummy. 
Also try the Thai Chicken skewers, Artichoke Croquettes, Louisiana Shrimp, or the Cracked Black pepper Calamari! 

This is a restaurant/bar! It's a joint, a neighborhood hang out.

A foodie website with lots of citizen reviewers is holding an event at your restaurant.  You go in knowing the people at the event will in all likelihood write reviews of your restaurant.

Do you:

A. Treat the attendees as if you are doing them a favor, run out of food early and generally put out the feeling that you would like the whole ordeal to be over as fast as possible so you can get these folks out of your establishment.

B. Seize the opportunity to put your best foot forward and capitalize on the opportunity to present your great food and friendly, professional staff to the reviewing community, in the hopes of receiving praise and business in return.

If you chose B you do not run Iruna.

To be honest, I am not privy to the negotiations and such that go on between Yelp and a restaurant hosting an event.  I do however have a solid grasp of business and marketing.

In my opinion, Iruna's behavior at the recent Yelp event reflected answer A above rather than B.  It was unfortunate.  

The food varied from good to mediocre.  I heard some folks got more than a few morsels, I'm not sure who they were.

I experienced attitude from staff members myself and witnessed a number of other people receive the same.  I was frankly quite surprised.  It was clear to me the staff did not grasp the opportunity they were presented with and viewed the event as a problem to get through.

As a contrast, I attended a Yelp event at The Breakfast Joynt over a year ago. The staff and management was pleasant and welcoming and the food was very good.  I have returned to The Breakfast Joynt 6-7 times since the event.

Bomberos is a place that's effortlessly cool and a surprising gem in the area.  For those that haven't been it's an old firehouse and the architecture and design is fantastic.  There's a large outdoor patio, as well as a fair amount of space inside.

Outside of some cheese/olive/meat trays, the menu basically breaks down to panini or bruschetta--with many of the same combinations.  I had both and my panini was a Spanish chorizo and was quite good.

Service was excellent, and wine selection is all South American.  If I had a complaint, I would say their price points are a bit high (at least by the glass).  Yes, I know they have to ship it ALL the way from another continent, but I'm pretty sure S American wine is relatively inexpensive from what I've bought.

Anyways, Bomberos is a great place to relax and enjoy some wine and company.  I was there on a Thursday with my aunt in from Seattle (which is a pretty cool city from what I remember) and she thought it was cool.  So yes, Bomberos is a cool place.  Check it out.",review,0,p8dSifN8MWzbygrSqoqOyA

Situated in the Mekong Plaza, the restaurant is attached an Asian market (which I wanted to explore after our meal!) and has an authentic feel to it.  We were promptly seated at a long communal table (different, but we didn't mind) and we ordered hot jasmine tea before we delved into the expansive menu.  

The tea was perfect and didn't have any jasmine leaves floating it (at Pho An Sen I was slighly irritated by this)--definitely my kind of tea.  We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pork to start.  I loved the warm tender shrimp and the crisp, fresh veggies.  They were served with peanut dipping sauce, and we experimented with the three sauces that were on our table (red chili sauce, hoisin sauce, sriacha).  

The menu was organized by broth: beef-based, chicken and pork-based, and regional flavors.  The server (I think he was the owner) asked if it was our first time eating Pho and took the time to explain the flavors of all of the broths.  I decided on the Pho with sliced chicken breast (it was listed under the beef-based section, although it was more of a rich chicken broth), and ordered it with bok choi, mushrooms, and broccoli.  It came with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime and basil.  The broth was complex, yet it had clarity to it.  It wasn't too oily (I HATE greasy-tasting Pho) and the chicken was lean.  Our server even showed us how to make the perfect dipping sauce (half hoisin, half sriacha and a squeeze of lime). 

My friend ordered the beef-based #3.  It was spiced perfectly, came out piping hot and wasn't loaded with fatty meat.  He ordered slices of rare beef on the side, which were very lean and incredibly tasty.  

On taste and service alone, I would have given unPhogettable five stars.  However, they closed at 9 on a Saturday night, and began to close up shortly after.  One of the waitresses propped open the door to shake out all of their floor mats.  This pissed me off because it was rainy and COLD outside, and it made both me and my Pho cold.  They started mopping and stacking the chairs before we even had a chance to pay.  It was like we were inconveniencing them for lingering at their restaurant.  This is one thing I HATE.

My favorites include anything with a chicken cutlet and how could I not mention Jay's homemade meatballs.  The roles are nice and soft and when toasted offer a nice crunch to accompany any of the tasty fillings.  Another suggestion is the chicken salad wrap with bacon.  Yum!  

I used to visit quite often, even for breakfast where Nicole would always make me a turkey wrap, a little oddity for breakfast foods.

The first was on St. Patrick's Day, shortly after the Flogging Molly concert at Tempe Beach Park let out...obviously this place would be busy.  We had to wait quite a bit to get the attention of the server, but the place was packed, so I can't hold this against them too much. 

The bruscetta and pizza we got was amazing, one of the better pies I've ever tasted.  With an extensive beer selection and full bar, with relatively competent bartenders that seemed to be able to keep up with the demand for drinks and extended hours, this seemed like a great place for a late night snack and nightcap.

The following week, we return on a Wednesday, about 2 hours before closing time.  We sat at a booth in the bar area and were met by a server relatively quickly.  Our order was taken and drinks brought out, only to find out that they are only doing slices of pizza at the time, not making any new ones...We figured we'd try it out and get a couple of slices with some pretzles to even it all out.  After finishing our slices and waiting for an extra 10-15 minutes, we finally flagged down the waitress and asked about the pretzles, she mentioned that the kitchen wasn't cooking anything new.

We also asked one of the bartenders (who may or may not have been a manager), when they killed the menu for future reference, and was told about 10 or 10:30 they went to slices only of whatever they had available (in a rather rude tone for someone addressing two of maybe 8 customers in the whole place...).  After eliciting our disappointment, they offered to comp our drinks, which were the most expensive items we ordered, which made the visit managable but still very disappointing.

Bottom Line:  Go for lunch, when it won't be too busy, and you'll have a chance at being treated properly.  After about 10pm or so, just go to Slices.",review,1,2tyadgcxcaEu5LWgLdwLAQ

Yeah when we parked we had to walk by some kind of club (in Glendale?) that actually had a red carpet...who knows?

Anyways...
I drove past Corbin's the other day on my way to Thunderbird park and told myself that I really wanted to try the place. On that very day, one of my best friends said she tried it and thought that my boyfriend and I would like so when it came time to decide on a dinner spot on Friday we opted to try something new! 

One of the many great things about Yelp is that it has actually enhanced out dining out experience because we start talking about my review the moment we sit down. 

Corbins has good intentions but the best phrase I can use sum up the place is 'Non-synthetic.' From the warehouse style ceilings to the bar that takes up half of the restaurant space to the only 3 comfortable looking booths, Corbin's really is lacking. 

Onto the food- 
The menu looked alright, resembling your typical bar/grill food. My boyfriend wanted to sample the onion rings and like Maggy said, these greasy rings seemed to be the best part of the menu. I tried to fight it but ended up trying 2 and yes they were good, and greasy. For our meals, I went with the Mediterranean salad with chicken and B went with some kind of chicken sandwich. My salad was really good and really fresh actually but B really did not enjoy the sandwich. On the way out of the restaurant we actually both felt sick. B said, ""Remind me not to order chicken sandwiches when we go out in the future."" Not really the first comments you want after dinner. 

Why 2 stars? The service was awesome. I don't remember his name but he was awesome and always kept out glasses full and did not slip on my salad, even with all the alterations I had.

I actually used to shop here quite a bit, but then moved down South, where it becomes much more of a trek to get to a Whole Foods. I've moved back up North, and now I can shop at this store again!

I went shopping here tonight, and I remembered why I love Whole Foods so much. All you have to do is look at the butter section understand why Whole Foods is so amazing. I counted at least 15 different kinds of butter, and each of them was unique in some way. At some point or another, I've tried each of them, and the more expensive, specialty brands are far superior to the regular butter you'd find on the shelves of most other grocers. I love Keri Gold Irish butter, which I get at Trader Joe's, but there are even better varieties of butter here. For people who are not familiar with the different varieties and qualities of butter, it may be a bit confusing to have so many different choices, but any of the butters here will do you just fine in any recipe. If you're making a special butter sauce for a hot date one night... I'd suggest that you splurge for one of the premium (and very expensive) butters. Just use it sparingly.

On the staple items: milk, bread, flour, etc, Whole Foods has reasonable prices, in line with other grocers (maybe not in line with other grocers' sale prices, but in line with the standard prices). If you want high-end specialty items, the nice thing about Whole Foods is that you can find them. The bad thing is that, if you love food like I do, you'll constantly be tempted to splurge on the better food items because... well... they're just sitting there, and on any particular item you think to yourself, ""it's not THAT much more, and it's SO much better..."" ... then you check out and realize that your quality-loving palate has spent you into debt on your weekly grocery shopping. My advice: go in with a plan on what you're going to get, and don't splurge on the high-end products unless it's a treat for yourself (and don't talk yourself into treating yourself on every item!), or you've got some ridiculously hot date who you're trying to impress.

I love the attitude of the people who work at the stores, and I love how responsive the store is to customer needs/wants. Several months back, I noticed that Whole Foods was getting low on Valrhona chocolate (which was the chocolate of choice at L'Orangerie Restaurant... and became a favorite of mine). I inquired about the low levels of chocolate, and was informed that they were discontinuing that product line in favor of another, lesser quality (in my mind) brand. I complained at the time. I came home with a bar of Valrhona chocolate tonight. Thank you, Whole Foods!

I love that when I buy fish they are not only happy to give me ice, but they expect that some people will ask (note: you should ALWAYS ask for ice when you buy fish), and they quickly and pleasantly retrieve ice for you. AND, when you check out (at least, here in ridiculously hot Arizona), they ask if you need ice for your groceries for the ride home. What service!

Interesting tidbit: Did you know that Whole Foods lets its employees at each store decide the decor of the store? That's why you'll find Whole Foods in some neighborhoods to be far more college-towny, while others, like this particular location (Scottsdale Rd &amp; Mayo) are very upscale. The stores are designed to the tastes of the residents surrounding the store... and Whole Foods corporate figured out that free market principles work: the corporate office has no clue what those of us in Scottsdale want our store to look/feel like... the employees who live around that store most certainly do. They delegate that job, and the result is that each store is slightly different, and caters to the people who are going to shop there: the locals.

Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. 

Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is ""The Heart Attack Grill"" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. 

Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said ""that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth"". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. 

The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.

P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger.

Thursday, Dec 23rd, 9:15 pm.  Busy.

Parking not so good, some tard parked in two spaces (light silver Nissan Altima circa. 2005-2007 model, you know who you are); I wanted to smear something like dijonaise sauce all over on his/her car, but seeing as it was Xmas and all...
 
There were many hipsters (I thought it was the National Hipsters Convention Phoenix 2011 at first), and I was worried the food would be pretentious and small portions, fortunately, that was not the case.

Seated right away, water right away, you will never get dehydrated here, they are constantly filling your glasses ( a + no matter what ).

Got nice Xmas pint of something beer, and ordered.  Pints were perfectly priced at $5.  Actually the prices were very reasonable IMO.

Started with the Bruchetta board (order of 4, you choose), an apple and fig one (OMG!), a Salmon one, a salami one, and one other, at first bite my fears of hipsters and small pretentious food quickly slipped away.  I am new to bruschetta, and I have to say, it was one of the best things I have ever had, and that bread, I would have bought a loaf if they sold it.

Next up, Potato and cheddar soup, amazingly good.  I made the mistake of getting a bowl, and all that bruschetta, and then ordering a pannini, I guess it was a rookie mistake, because with that bruchetta board they give you a lot of food, which is well worth the price.

Tried the pannini with bacon and chicken (sorry forget the name), no matter it was great.  Again, I ordered too much food.  But you only live once ( I hope ).

Service was very very efficient, I have never seen tables bussed that fast once someone leaves, it takes seconds, and it seems like that former patron was never even there only moments ago?  We had a couple hipster servers with the sensitive beard thing going on, but they were very good at what they do, and very pleasant, and again, efficient.

It was a bit noisy in there, and pretty chilly too.  Seems like they keep some door to the bar area open, but after a couple beers you get used to it.  I imagine it is necessary as it gets so packed in there?  Oh cool bathrooms too.

I would totally go back, it was amazing.  For a moment I thought I was in Seattle or Portland and not here.  Great progress for Phoenix, I must say.  Actually, I will be back very soon.

I will just go there late, to avoid the rush.  No matter, I was quite impressed with the food, highly recommended!!


Actually, it was one of the best things I have had in some time!

Oh, the hipsters were not so bad in retrospect, and they really seem to love bruschetta?

I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but ""butterburger"" and ""frozen yogurt"" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.
Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.
The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8"" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the ""value basket"" deal.
Their frozen yogurt or ""concrete mix"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their ""brownie cookie dough"".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! 
Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating.",review,1,TVMLSvdYuHK3BOwh-kafRQ

we confirmed with them numerous times what would be the right procedure to get a ceritifcate (we dont mind if they said yes or no , with whatever they find and if they think i was unfit  to fly), so we left since they said we should be able to fly under 36 weeks with no problem, but when we got home and checked the website for cathay pacific they required a medical certificate if you are at 27 weeks and 6 days.
so i received a miss call the next morning and called back and was directed to the office manager NICOLE W. and she started going off that our intentions are wrong and how we refused to pay 1600 for the visit (when all we did was clarify how much would a wellness visit be) and that we are not going to jeoperdize their practice and how we are trying to trick them to sign a document and end up being liable if anything happens, and that (here goes) YOU CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THIS IN THIS COUNTRY... and i was in shock when being attacked that way and how she had witnesses on the trouble we did at the doctors office the day before and she has witnesses, i was appalled because this was all false, my sister has been seeing the the last 3 years  and how they made that judgement call surpised us. then she said you sound like your smart and you know what you are doing so you should know how this works, what got me was i am not the doctor here i am a patient that is why the past month a half i called to clarify these things because "" I AM NOT A DOCTOR"" money is not an object we dont mind paying if we have to , if i am not able to fly and will ahve to deliver here that is fine, i am a cash paying patient and have no intention of using any state medical assistance of payment plans with them if the time came i would have to deliver in phoenix.

on the brighter side we spoke with arrowhead oby gyn and they will gladly accept us and make any assesment possible, and they are going to take me in this afternoon with no problems so we can make any necessary arrangements if a flight needs to be cancelled.
i am disappointed with what happened , you would think educated individuals would handle the situation better and in a more professional manner. all she had to do was take a breathe and approach the situation , i think being condescending is not the way to solve a problem. 
i hope all can understand where we are coming from , i felt like a 90 mph fast ball came at me out of nowhere, and all we wanted to to was ask what would be a good idea and they just started making biased conclusions against me.
no my sister was always wondering why their waiting area is so empty and the carpets has black spots all over the place , i guess their priority is geared more on to bullying patients more than anything.",review,1,3x8qU9G-3GubhIH3UZ_MPA

Pros:
-Great ambiance. From the bar to the patio to the dining room to the restrooms, this is a beautiful restaurant. It was almost enough to make me forget I was dining in a shopping mall and is very different from all of the other steakhouses in the Valley. 
-Chopped Salad. The GF and I both declared this was the best chopped salad that we've had in PHX. Pretty unique and really tasty. We both said we would go back and eat this and some apps at the bar in the future.
-Pretty good wine list. Not the best in town, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had super low expectations in this category due to my experiences with other Fox restaurants, but the wine list here exceeded my expectations. 
-Oysters. High quality Fanny Bay oysters. We love good oysters and these were very good. Granted, the kitchen doesn't do a whole lot to prepare raw oysters, but Modern Steak has a very good supplier when it comes to their oysters.

Cons:
-Arrived at 8:10p for a 8:15p reservation. Hostess said it would be ""closer to 8:15p"" before we were seated. It wasn't until 8:40p that we were seated and there were several empty tables in the dining room when we were seated. I know they might not have had staff for these tables, but what's the point of a reservation if they don't seat you until nearly 30 minutes past your reservation?
-My steak was cold. Cooked perfectly, but stone cold. I knew it was a bad sign when the steaks were delivered 10 seconds after our salad plates were cleared. They were obviously sitting at the window for a long time before they were sent out. When you're paying more than $40 for a steak, it shouldn't be stone cold. I mentioned this to our server and she said that she would tell the chef. She offered to take it back to the kitchen and cook it some more, but that would defeat the purpose of ordering a medium rare steak if they had to cook it to medium or more just for it not to be stone cold. Other than that interaction with our server, nothing else was said about the chilly steak. No visit from the manager, no offer to comp dessert, nothing. And this was on a table that spent $289 for dinner for two. 

The quality of the meat was pretty good, but you can get better steaks at City Hall, J&G or BLT for about the same price. Sides were decent (brussels sprouts and mac & cheese), but nothing that absolutely rocked my world. in the end, we decided Modern Steak isn't a place we would go back to for a full dinner since there are other much better steakhouses in town. Instead, next time we'll hit up the bar for happy hour, get the chopped salad, some apps and a few cocktails and call it an evening. That way we can avoid the cold steaks and lackadaisical attitude towards reservations and customer service.",review,2,4kfvccmKDUgCXu_jLYm5dQ

I'd give the salad a 3.5 because it didn't take my breath away, but it is better than your average. There is corn, carrots, avocado, and fresh tomatoes inside. There is sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and it brings a nice touch. 

Oyster - I'd give 3 stars. It tastes a bit salty. After eating some of the best oysters in New Orleans, this one is just not up to par. It looks pretty, but it tastes like the type of oysters are picked from salty water, not fresh ones. Don't get the oysters, save yourself for some of the best. 

Everything here is well priced. The burger is a bit bigger than an in-n-out burger. The sides are bit burned and if I had to choose, I'd spend the extra few buck to purchase a burger at Joe's Farm grill. Service here is impeccable with fancy silverware.

To begin with our friendly server suggested a wine - we were surprised to learn it was a pricey $12 a glass. And my lunch buddy said he didn't particularly like the wine either.  Be sure to check the wine list BEFORE ordering.  

A warm basket of bread was brought to the table. However, the bread was not chewy or tasty but had an odd cakelike texture.

I was expecting a hearty minestrome soup.  This was not hearty - a thin, bland tomato broth with lots of pasta.  Adding some grated parmesan gave some flavor. Olive Garden's pasta fagioli soup is 100 percent better.

I had the seared salmon over curly pasta in a light creamy sauce.  It was tasty probably due to the crushed red pepper I asked for.  Leftovers that I removed from my frig the following day were rock hard.  I guess the sauce wasn't all that light - probably lots of cheese and butter.  My buddy liked his pork panini although the huge leaves of rapini made for messy eating.

Had to try the Italian ricotta cheesecake but wish I hadn't bothered.  It was a big slice, bland and flavorless - 8 dollars a slice!  Lately other restaurants are offering smaller desserts which I like - less calories and cheaper.

That being said, this is by far the best Thai food in the Phoenix, and surrounding, areas. My first experience was after having a tooth pulled. I needed to eat, but it needed to be soft, and I was craving Thai. So my amazing partner ran over and grabbed me some Pad See Eew and an order of crab  puffs. 

The Pad See Eew was the best I've had outside of Bangkok. The flavours were perfectly balanced and it absolutely reminded me of home. They weren't stingy with the protein (chicken) and it didn't seem to be an Americanised version of one of my favourite Thai dishes. And the crab puffs... My partner had a couple and her response to them was, ""These are the best crab puffs i've ever had!"" Not your usual wonton wrapper stuffed with cream cheese with virtually no crab, these are filled with cheesy, crabby, seasoned goodness. So much flavour packed into such a little pouch. And they're served with a sweet chili sauce for dipping. 

The second time we ate there, we actually went to the restaurant. It was around 3:30pm on a Saturday so we were pretty much the only people in there. I ordered a Thai iced tea and my partner got a green tea. My Thai iced tea was perfect. Not to sweet, unlike many of the other Thai restaurants I've been to. The green tea was a little strong, and my partner says she's just going to get water from now on. Not because the drinks are bad, but because unlike the majority of restaurants, they serve purified water. Not tap water. MAJOR brownie points there! 

We, of course, started out with the crab puffs, which were just as good as the first time. I ordered yellow curry with chicken, and my partner ordered the cashew chicken, both Thai hot. Ordering food ""Thai hot"" can be hit or miss. Many places see the ginger hair and pale skin and figure they can dumb down the Thai hot and I'd never notice. F*ck that! When I say ""Thai hot,"" I mean ""Thai hot!"" And that's exactly what we got. 

The cashew chicken was phenomenal. The smell alone brought back to living in Bangkok and eating at the noodle shop across from my school. It was spicy enough to make my nose run and leave that warm, tingly feeling in my mouth and throat but still had incredible flavour. My partner said it was ""amazing."" (She's not quite the foodie I am, so for her, that's a high compliment.) My curry was pretty damn good, too. Spicy, flavourful, full of large pieces of chicken as well as all the other good stuff (potatoes, carrots, etc). I could smell it as soon as it was set down and I knew it was going to be hot, and I wasn't disappointed. We had enough left over to take home and have for breakfast the next day. The portions are more than generous.

Our server was extremely attentive. Almost overly so, but I was glad for that as opposed to being practically ignored, which can happen when you're the only patrons in a restaurant. He came over at least twice to make sure our food was ok, and always made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed, ie. napkins, more tea, water, etc. 

Being so stuffed I didn't get a chance to try their mangoes and sticky rice, but it's on my list since it's one of my favourite foods ever! 

The menu is extensive, with all sorts of noodles, stir-frys, curries, etc you can imagine. They have a lunch menu served daily til 3pm (including weekends) that have the same dishes for $6.75, which is what we plan on shooting for next time. 

If you like Thai food, this is a must-try!",review,2,uWr21MBjmfojZ4MFaVlong

The yogurt is the usual frozen yogurt.  The only non-dairy choice I've ever seen there is the pineapple sorbet stuff.  I can't find a list of flavors online and it'd be nice to see a list posted in the window or something so I don't have to wander around the back of the shop to formulate a plan of attack.  

The topping bar has the usual add-ons, but the magnetized dispensers seem to always fall off in my hand as I'm trying to turn the handle to get the right amount.  About half of the time, I have way too much in the measuring cup below. What exaclty am I supposed to do with an extra half a cup of Oreo crumbs?  Leave them?  Dump them in my bowl?  Speaking of the Oreos, those dispensers are not a good match for things that are better left in chunks, rather than powder.  Same goes for the Butterfinger chunks.

With that in mind, the Beautiful Carin and I, while we were out running a few errands today, were trying to decide what to do for lunch. 
Instead of the sandwich or late Sunday breakfast option, we were close to Humble Pie and decided to stop in. 
We hadn't been there in 3-4 months (one of the things I love about Yelp is that it pushes me to both try new places and revisit spots that I haven't been to in awhile).
It was not busy, which was both a blessing and disquieting. There should be more people there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon! 
The food is really very good, and the service was excellent (both better than the last time we were there, I think). 
I don't know if I attribute that to a less crowded place, or just improvements in everything, overall. I don't know and I shouldn't over-analyze.
We sat on the patio, and it is very comfortable and pleasant out there. This is a quiet corner of the Hilton Village strip mall, so it's easy to enjoy a conversation with out traffic and noise.
We had a sausage and roasted fennel pizza and veggie salad. Both were terrific! I prefer a more savory than sweet pizza, generally, and this one walked the line nicely. The tomato sauce and the roasted fennel have just enough sweetness to provide a counterpoint to the salty sausage and olives. Crust has a great texture and flavor, in and of itself, and was nicely baked, with just a little blackness at the edges. Nice Job!
The salad was extremely fresh and nicely dressed. 
Add in decent hefevitzen and that's what I call lunch!",review,3,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g

Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... 

During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day).
